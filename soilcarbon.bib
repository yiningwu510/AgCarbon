  abstract = {Randomized clinical trials (RCT) are accepted as the gold-standard approaches to measure effects of intervention or treatment on outcomes. They are also the designs of choice for health technology assessment (HTA). Randomization ensures comparability, in both measured and unmeasured pretreatment characteristics, of individuals assigned to treatment and control or comparator. However, even adequately powered RCTs are not always feasible for several reasons such as cost, time, practical and ethical constraints, and limited generalizability. RCTs rely on data collected on selected, homogeneous population under highly controlled conditions; hence, they provide evidence on efficacy of interventions rather than on effectiveness. Alternatively, observational studies can provide evidence on the relative effectiveness or safety of a health technology compared to one or more alternatives when provided under the setting of routine health care practice. In observational studies, however, treatment assignment is a non-random process based on an individual’s baseline characteristics; hence, treatment groups may not be comparable in their pretreatment characteristics. As a result, direct comparison of outcomes between treatment groups might lead to biased estimate of the treatment effect. Propensity score approaches have been used to achieve balance or comparability of treatment groups in terms of their measured pretreatment covariates thereby controlling for confounding bias in estimating treatment effects. Despite the popularity of propensity scores methods and recent important methodological advances, misunderstandings on their applications and limitations are all too common. In this article, we present a review of the propensity scores methods, extended applications, recent advances, and their strengths and limitations.},

  abstract = {'Corn, Carbon, and Conservation: Rethinking U.S. Agricultural Policy in a  Changing Global Environment', is the first law review article to explore the complex relationship between U.S. agricultural policy, as reflected in the 2008 “Farm Bill,” and the current climate change and energy crises.  In recent years, the public has renewed its interest in ensuring that the food it eats is healthy and is grown in ways that are environmentally and economically sustainable. The immense popularity of books such as The Omnivore’s Dilemma, the widespread “locavore” movement, First Lady Michelle Obama’s White House lawn vegetable garden, concerns over genetically modified crops, rising food prices, growing concerns over the government’s misguided policy to promote corn ethanol, and the climate change crisis have refocused the public’s attention on the nation’s agricultural policies and their impact on human health and the environment and a sustainable energy future. This Article explores a range of issues related to both the regulatory and incentive-based federal programs that affect the crops we grow, the manner in which they are grown, and the human and environmental impacts of such programs.  One of the most promising means of accomplishing the goal of transforming our agricultural system into one that is environmentally and economically sustainable is to combine existing commodity subsidy programs with existing conservation subsidy programs into one subsidy program, which compensates farmers of a wide variety of crops for conserving a range of critical ecosystem services.  Such an approach could result in a shift from an agricultural system in which croplands are in essence industrial wastelands with little or no ecological value and which are used primarily to produce industrial feedstocks, to a more sustainable system in which agricultural lands are healthy, sustainable systems providing a number of critical ecosystem services that benefit the public and serving as a source of healthful food.},

In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data.

Data were collected from field experiments for a 3-y period following application of pine wood biochar at rates of 0, 10, and 20 Mg ha−1. For corn plots, at harvest 3 y after biochar application, 20 Mg biochar ha−1 resulted in 41.2\% lower soil NH \$ \_4\^+ \$ on the loamy sand; the same effect was not present on the sandy clay loam soil. On the loamy sand, 20 Mg biochar ha−1 increased corn yields by 14.2\% compared to the control 3 y after application; the same effect was not present on the sandy clay loam soil. Biochar did not alter yield or nutrient availability in soil on soybean or switchgrass plots on either soil type. After 3 y, SOC concentration was 83 and 258\% greater after 10 and 20 Mg ha−1 biochar applications, respectively, than the control in sandy clay loam soil under switchgrass production. The same effect was not present on the sandy clay loam soil. A 67\% higher SOC concentration was noted with biochar application at 20 Mg ha−1 to sandy clay loam soil under corn.},

  abstract = {Capturing the variability in soil-landscape properties is a challenge for grain producers attempting to integrate spatial information into the decision process of precision agriculture (PA). Digital soil maps (DSMs) use traditional soil survey information and can be the basis for PA subfield delineation (e.g., management zones). However, public soil survey maps provide only general descriptions of soil-landscape features. Therefore, improved DSMs are needed that use high-resolution data that more precisely model soil-landscape characteristics. Additionally, reliable methods are needed to validate DSM products for PA. The objective of this study was to validate with corn (Zea mays L.) yield data the performance of a new DSM product, termed Environmental Response Unit (ERU), compared with the USDA Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) soil map. The ERU was developed by integrating SSURGO information with high-resolution elevation data. For validation, corn yield maps were collected and corrected for common data collection errors from 409 fields across Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska in 2010 to 2012. Reductions in the area-weighted variance (Rv) of corn yield for ERU and SSURGO were calculated relative to the whole-field variance. The average Rv across all site-years for SSURGO and ERU was 16 and 25\%, respectively, which equated to a 57\% higher median yield variance reduction with ERU over SSURGO. This variance reduction technique showed the potential of ERU as an improved model better representing soil-landscape properties that impact corn yield. This research also has application potential for determining the success of a DSM for identifying management zones in PA. The variance reduction metric (Rv) provided a direct comparison between DSM models. The greatest reduction in corn yield variance was exhibited by the ERU DSM model. Physiographic derivatives from high-precision data sets improved DSM functionality. Yield data helped outline interrelationships among various soil properties.},

  abstract = {Urban areas are major producers of atmospheric CO2 emissions, but at the same time they can offset some of the associated C losses by retaining stable organic carbon in their soils (SOC). Despite the importance of urban SOC there are still many uncertainties associated, resulting in low accuracy of SOC stock estimations or in its neglection in the regional and national carbon budgets. We focused on one of the most extended urban areas of Italy (Milan) estimating SOC stock in the topsoil and comparing it for different urban land uses (park/non-park) and covers (woodland/grassland). We also compared urban SOC stocks with other typologies of natural and semi-natural land use in the region. We found generally high variability in urban soil properties. Average SOC of urban parks was higher (7.9~±~2.4~kg~m−2) than urban non-parks (5.3~±~2.5~kg~m−2); while SOC stock did not significantly differ for urban land cover types. Urban parks had SOC stock values comparable with forest, pasture and grasslands of the same region and higher than SOC of croplands. At the same time, urban non-parks had the lower SOC stocks values found in the region. The results highlighted the significant contribution of urban SOC stock to carbon budget estimations and differences based on urban land use types. Furthermore, we described the main pedological characteristics of investigated urban soils and we identified the factors that contribute to limiting our capacity to model urban SOC stock that can be partially overcome by the addressed strategies.},

  abstract = {Using land already enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the eastern region of the U.S. for producing energy crops for bioenergy while reducing land rental payments offers the potential for lowering the program costs, increasing returns to CRP landowners, and displacing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuels. We develop an integrated modeling approach to analyze the combination of biomass prices and CRP land rental payment reductions that can incentivize energy crop production on CRP land and its potential to increase soil carbon stocks and displace fossil fuel emissions. We find that conversion of 3.4 million ha in the CRP can be economically viable at a minimum biomass price of \$75 Mg–1 with full CRP land rental payment or at \$100 Mg–1 with 75\% of this land rental payment; this conversion can result in savings of 0.52 and 1.25 billion Mg CO2-eq in life-cycle emissions through the displacement of energy-equivalent fossil fuels and coal-based electricity, respectively, and an additional 0.11 billion Mg CO2-eq soil carbon sequestration relative to the status quo, with CRP left unharvested over the 2016–2030 period. The soil carbon debt due to the transition from unharvested CRP land to energy crops is short-lived and more than offset by the reduction in fossil fuel emissions. The net discounted benefits from producing energy crops on CRP land through a reduced need for government payments to maintain existing enrollment, higher returns to CRP landowners, and the value of the reduction in GHG emissions could be as high as \$16–\$30 billion by using them for cellulosic biofuels to displace gasoline and \$35–\$68 billion by displacing coal-based electricity over the 2016–2030 period if biomass prices are \$75–\$125 Mg–1 and land rental payments are reduced by 25\%.},

  abstract = {Conservation tillage has been widely recommended for implementation in the U.S. for its environmental benefits. The effect of conservation tillage on crop yield is a subject of continued concern amongst farmers who have not adopted the practice. Previous empirical research on the yield performance of conservation tillage is largely limited to field trials, while observational studies remain scant. This article estimates the effects of conservation tillage on county average corn and soybean yields using remotely-sensed tillage practice adoption data in 646 counties across 12 Corn Belt states from 2005 to 2018. Exploiting deviations from county-specific means in the data, we find no evidence that conservation tillage negatively affects corn or soybean yields. We also find that it can mitigate the impact of drought on soybean yields. We explore how wider use of conservation tillage might offset the increase in drought-induced downside risk to soybean yields under climate change projections from five global climate models.},

  abstract = {Soil management techniques, such as mulching, are used to enhance soil organic carbon sequestration. However, we demonstrate that the potential of crop residue mulching to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration varies by cropping system and soil type in Austrian agricultural soils. Effects of mulch (as harvested crop residues applied at 1.0 t C ha−1) on soil and microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and soil δ13C were measured in an Austrian Cambisol field experiment with sole maize or vetch or vetch-maize rotation cropping systems after five years with or without mulching to elucidate how SOC is affected. The direct role of mulch on SOC in different soil types was also investigated in a similar greenhouse mesocosm study with controlled moisture using the same Cambisols and an Austrian agricultural Chernozem. Only sole maize cropping in the field experiment resulted in higher SOC with mulching and when legumes were included in a legume-maize rotation SOC did not improve. Mulching in the field experiment only resulted in higher SOC in the top 0–5\,cm of soils with sole maize cropping (by 22\%) compared to soils without mulch. Although mulch did not increase SOC in vetch-maize rotation, the δ13C of SOC was less negative with mulch indicating larger C contribution from maize than vetch mulch. After four years of annual soybean-maize rotation in the mesocosm experiment, no significant differences in SOC were observed in Cambisols with or without mulch. Again, δ13C of both soil types was less negative with mulching indicating a larger C contribution from maize than soybean mulch. No relationships between microbial biomass C and N and SOC were observed in either experiment and only soil N concentration was positively correlated with SOC. Together these studies indicate that maize can increase SOC when crop residues are applied in Austrian Cambisols but that inclusion of legume production and legume mulch in rotation can mute these benefits.},

This study examines how bioenergy and marketed environmental rents for forestland potentially influence land use in the Midwestern US. We hypothesize that current land uses reflect market values for environmental benefits of forestland, so that the marketed component of the environmental value of land can be captured as the difference between Census land values and value of land as a timber asset. We use a multinomial logit model to estimate the land use shares of forests, crops and urban in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The results show that marketed environmental rents increase forestland relative to cropland. To examine the effects of biofuels on land use, we conduct policy analysis by altering future land rents. Our baseline scenario projects that urban development uses mostly cropland, but with higher crop rents resulting from increased demand for bioenergy, there will be significant losses of forestland to urban and cropland. On the other hand, if marketed environmental rents grow while crop rents are maintained at their baseline value, urban growth will occur, primarily at the expense of cropland.},

The predictions are then combined with site-specific environmental production functions to determine the effect of revenue insurance on nitrate runoff and leaching, soil water and wind erosion, and carbon sequestration. Results suggest that federal crop insurance has, on average, a small effect on conversions of non-cropland to cropland, and somewhat more significant impacts on crop choice and crop rotation.

  abstract = {Grasslands are heavily relied upon for food and forage production. A key component for sustaining production in grassland ecosystems is the maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM), which can be strongly influenced by management. Many management techniques intended to increase forage production may potentially increase SOM, thus sequestering atmospheric carbon (C). Further, conversion from either cultivation or native vegetation into grassland could also sequester atmospheric carbon. We reviewed studies examining the influence of improved grassland management practices and conversion into grasslands on soil C worldwide to assess the potential for C sequestration. Results from 115 studies containing over 300 data points were analyzed. Management improvements included fertilization (39\%), improved grazing management (24\%), conversion from cultivation (15\%) and native vegetation (15\%), sowing of legumes (4\%) and grasses (2\%), earthworm introduction (1\%), and irrigation (1\%). Soil C content and concentration increased with improved management in 74\% of the studies, and mean soil C increased with all types of improvement. Carbon sequestration rates were highest during the first 40 yr after treatments began and tended to be greatest in the top 10 cm of soil. Impacts were greater in woodland and grassland biomes than in forest, desert, rain forest, or shrubland biomes. Conversion from cultivation, the introduction of earthworms, and irrigation resulted in the largest increases. Rates of C sequestration by type of improvement ranged from 0.11 to 3.04 Mg C·ha−1 yr−1, with a mean of 0.54 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1, and were highly influenced by biome type and climate. We conclude that grasslands can act as a significant carbon sink with the implementation of improved management.},

  abstract = {Sustainable agricultural practices are becoming more important as concerns over climate change increases. Climate change brings with it the concern of decreasing yields from increasing drought frequency and weather variability. One practice that may help reduce the impact of climate change and currently receiving increased attention is cover crops. They are well regarded in their ability to provide current and future benefits to the farmer and the nearby ecosystem. As a result, some states have been actively working on encouraging their use. However, the existence of stringent cover crop initiation and termination rules needed to remain eligible for crop insurance coverage means that farmers may avoid the risk of losing their coverage by avoiding the use of cover crops. Moral hazard may also be involved in reducing the use of such and other sustainable agricultural practices. In this study, we investigate whether such a link between cover crop use and crop insurance participation exists. We use an exogenous policy shock, the passage of the 2008 Farm Bill, as an instrument for crop insurance participation. We find that indeed a negative link exists between the use of cover crops and the amount of crop insurance purchased by farmers.},

Yet, few understand where or when erosion occurs, or the dynamics of soil erosion, the relative impact of precipitation, topography, land management and severe events over time and space. The objectives of this project are to: 1) develop methodology for estimating near real time spatial and temporal soil erosion and water runoff losses; and 2) explore issues in applying the method to a large area by setting up and running a prototype system for the state of Iowa. To accomplish this, soil erosion and water runoff loss are estimated daily at the township level (-10 by -10 km area) (-6.2 mi)2 and a map is posted on the Internet daily showing precipitation with runoff and soil erosion estimates for every Iowa township. We use Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), a daily simulation model, to compute soil erosion and surface runoff. WEPP uses accumulated precipitation by 15-minute periods obtained with NEXRAD radar. Other needed weather data are obtained from an Iowa weather network. The National Resources Inventory provides soil, topography, cropping and management information required for running WEPP. Daily and annual spatial precipitation, runoff and erosion estimates illustrate a high level of spatial variability related to topography, precipitation characteristics, soils and management practices.},

Because land is a basic source of mass and energy throughput in all terrestrial ecosystems, land use and cover represents an integrating element in ecological economics. We have developed a global model that captures this concept. We illustrate this concept's usefulness by showing how global changes in climate, human populations, and international trade policies might affect tropical forests. Results from our scenarios indicate that such changes would likely have adverse effects on the health and integrity of tropical forest ecosystems. Results from our scenarios also indicate that forest depletion in Southeast Asia can be correlated with numerous economic indicators. Whether the correlation with a particular economic variable is positive or negative depends on the global change scenario. This merely reflects the fact that interactions between economic and ecological phenomena are complex. Modeling capabilities can be expanded by adding economic and ecological detail, including more material on throughput, and developing methods for simulating dynamic analyses.},

Few studies have used archived samples, long-term resampling of soils to a depth of 1 m, and space for time studies to document these changes. We resampled soils by depth (0–100 cm) in fields at 19 locations in central Illinois on poorly drained Mollisols that were in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) rotations, were tile drained, and had no known history of manure application in recent decades. Three fields were paired with virgin prairie remnants, two had grass borders that were sampled, and 16 had been previously sampled in 1901 to 1904 or 1957 under various land uses (virgin prairie, cultivation, grass cover). The soils had large amounts of C and N in the profile, with mean values of 179 Mg C ha−1 and 16.1 Mg N ha−1 for the 18 cultivated fields sampled in 2001 and 2002. We confirmed a large reduction in organic C and total N pools from conversion of prairies to annual cultivation and artificial drainage and documented no change in these organic matter pools of cultivated soils during the period of synthetic fertilizer use (1957–2002). Cultivated fields had soil C and N concentrations typically 30 to 50\% less than virgin prairie soils. Smaller but significant declines in C and N concentrations were found when comparing 1900s cultivated fields to concentrations in 2002, after another 100 yr of cultivation, and in comparing 1957 grass covered fields that had been converted to annual cultivation before 2002. The reduction in organic matter after cultivation of prairies occurred mostly in the top 50 cm of soil, with evidence of translocation of C and N from these upper layers to the 50- to 100-cm depth, possibly enhanced by tile drainage. For these Mollisols, declines in organic matter were likely completed by the 1950s, with organic matter pools in a steady state under the production practices in place from the late 1950s through 2002.},

  abstract = {Cover crops are gaining traction in many agricultural regions, partly driven by increased public subsidies and by private markets for ecosystem services. These payments are motivated by environmental benefits, including improved soil health, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic carbon. However, previous work based on experimental plots or crop modeling indicates cover crops may reduce crop yields. It remains unclear, though, how recent cover crop adoption has affected productivity in commercial agricultural systems. Here we perform the first large-scale, field-level analysis of observed yield impacts from cover cropping as implemented across the US Corn Belt. We use validated satellite data products at sub-field scales to analyze maize and soybean yield outcomes for over 90,000 fields in 2019–2020. Because we lack data on cover crop species or timing, we seek to quantify the yield impacts of cover cropping as currently practiced in aggregate. Using causal forests analysis, we estimate an average maize yield loss of 5.5\% on fields where cover crops were used for 3 or more years, compared with fields that did not adopt cover cropping. Maize yield losses were larger on fields with better soil ratings, cooler mid-season temperatures, and lower spring rainfall. For soybeans, average yield losses were 3.5\%, with larger impacts on fields with warmer June temperatures, lower spring and late-season rainfall, and, to a lesser extent, better soils. Estimated impacts are consistent with multiple mechanisms indicated by experimental and simulation-based studies, including the effects of cover crops on nitrogen dynamics, water consumption, and soil oxygen depletion. Our results suggest a need to improve cover crop management to reduce yield penalties, and a potential need to target subsidies based on likely yield impacts. Ultimately, avoiding substantial yield penalties is important for realizing widespread adoption and associated benefits for water quality, erosion, soil carbon, and greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {The DAYCENT ecosystem model (a daily version of CENTURY) and an emission factor (EF) methodology used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were used to estimate direct and indirect N2O emission for major cropping systems in the USA. The EF methodology is currently used for the USA greenhouse gas inventory but process based models, such as DAYCENT, may yield more reliable results because they account for factors such as soil type, climate, and tillage intensity that are ignored by EF. Comparison of mean annual soil N2O flux estimated by DAYCENT and EF with measured data for different cropping systems yielded r2 values of 0.74 and 0.67, and mean deviations of −6 and +13\%, respectively. At the national scale, DAYCENT simulation of total N2O emission was ∼25\% lower than estimated using EF. For both models, N2O emission was highest in the central USA followed by the northwest, southwest, southeast, and northeast regions. The models simulated roughly equivalent direct N2O emission from fertilized crops, but EF estimated greater direct N2O emission than DAYCENT for N-fixing crops. DAYCENT and EF estimates of the gaseous component of indirect N2O emission (NO+NH3) differed little, but DAYCENT estimated approximately twice the indirect emission from NO3 leaching since it included the contribution of N from N-fixing crops while EF did not. DAYCENT simulations were also performed for no tillage cropping, pre-1940 crop management, and native vegetation. DAYCENT-simulated N2O, CO2, and CH4 fluxes were converted to CO2–C equivalents and combined with fuel use estimates to estimate net global warming potential (GWPnet). GWPnet for recent non-rice (Oryza sativa L.) major cropping was 0.43MgCha−1yr−1 under conventional tillage and 0.29MgCha−1yr−1 under no tillage, for pre-industrial cropping was 0.25MgCha−1yr−1, and for native systems was −0.15MgCha−1yr−1. Results from DAYCENT suggest that conversion to no tillage at the national scale could mitigate ∼20\% of USA agricultural emission or ∼1.5\% of total USA emission of greenhouse gases.},

  abstract = {Conversion of native vegetation to cropland and intensification of agriculture typically result in increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (mainly N2O and CH4) and more NO3 leached below the root zone and into waterways. Agricultural soils are often a source but can also be a sink of CO2. Regional and larger scale estimates of GHG emissions are usually obtained using IPCC emission factor methodology, which is associated with high uncertainty. To more realistically represent GHG emissions we used the DAYCENT biogeochemical model for non-rice major crop types (corn, wheat, soybean). IPCC methodology estimates N losses from croplands based solely on N inputs. In contrast, DAYCENT accounts for soil class, daily weather, historical vegetation cover, and land management practices such as crop type, fertilizer additions, and cultivation events. Global datasets of weather, soils, native vegetation, and cropping fractions were mapped to a 1.9°×1.9° resolution. Non-spatial data (e.g., rates and dates of fertilizer applications) were assumed to be identical within crop types across regions. We compared model generated baseline GHG emissions and N losses for irrigated and rainfed cropping with land management alternatives intended to mitigate GHG emissions. Reduced fertilizer resulted in lower N losses, but crop yields were reduced by a similar proportion. Use of nitrification inhibitors and split fertilizer applications both led to increased (\textasciitilde 6\%) crop yields but the inhibitor led to a larger reduction in N losses (\textasciitilde 10\%). No-till cultivation, which led to C storage, combined with nitrification inhibitors, resulted in reduced GHG emissions of \textasciitilde 50\% and increased crop yields of \textasciitilde 7\%.},

However, the relative impacts of various agricultural management practices on soil organic matter dynamics and, therefore, C sequestration at spatial scales larger than a single plot or times longer than the typical three year experiment have rarely been reported. Results of maintaining agricultural management practices in the forest-derived soils of the eastern Corn (Zea mays L.) Belt states of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania (USA) were studied. We found annual organic C input and tillage intensity were the most important factors in affecting C sequestration. The impact of rotation on C sequestration was primarily related to the way it altered annual total C inputs. The removal of above-ground plant biomass and use of cover crops were of lesser importance. The most rapid changes in soil organic matter content occurred during the first five years after a management practice was imposed with slower changes occurring thereafter. Certain management practices, e.g. no-tillage (NT), increased the soil's ability to sequester atmospheric CO2. The impact of this sequestration will be significant only when these practices are used extensively on a large percentage of cropland and when the C-building practices are maintained. Any soil C sequestered will be rapidly mineralized to CO2 if the soil organic matter building practices are not maintained.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest terrestrial carbon (C) sink on Earth; this pool plays a critical role in ecosystem processes and climate change. Given the cost and time required to measure SOC, and particularly changes in SOC, many signatory nations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change report estimates of SOC stocks and stock changes using default values from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or country-specific models. In the United States, SOC in forests is monitored by the national forest inventory (NFI) conducted by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. The FIA program has been consistently measuring soil attributes as part of the NFI since 2001 and has amassed an extensive inventory of SOC in forest land in the conterminous United States and southeast and southcentral coastal Alaska. That said, the FIA program has been using country-specific predictions of SOC based, in part, upon a model using SOC estimates from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database compiled by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Estimates obtained from the STATSGO database are averages over large map units and are not expected to provide accurate estimates for specific locations, e.g., NFI plots. To improve the accuracy of SOC estimates in U.S. forests, NFI SOC observations were used for the first time to predict SOC density to a depth of 100 cm for all forested NFI plots. Incorporating soil-forming factors along with observations of SOC into a new estimation framework resulted in a 75\% (48 ± 0.78 Mg/ha) increase in SOC densities nationally. This substantially increases the contribution of the SOC pool, from approximately 44\% (17 Pg) of the total forest ecosystem C stocks to 56\% (28 Pg), in the forest C budget of the United States.},

  abstract = {Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (−25\%) and perennial crops (−30\%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12\%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (−9\%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29\%) or under cropland fallow (+32\%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26\%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28\%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.},

  abstract = {Bioenergy crops are expected to provide biomass to replace fossil resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are of primary importance. The aim of this study was to measure changes in SOC stocks in bioenergy cropping systems comparing perennial (Miscanthus × giganteus and switchgrass), semi-perennial (fescue and alfalfa), and annual (sorghum and triticale) crops, all established after arable crops. The soil was sampled at the start of the experiment and 5 or 6 years later. SOC stocks were calculated at equivalent soil mass, and δ13C measurements were used to calculate changes in new and old SOC stocks. Crop residues found in soil at the time of SOC measurements represented 3.5–7.2 t C ha−1 under perennial crops vs. 0.1–0.6 t C ha−1 for the other crops. During the 5-year period, SOC concentrations under perennial crops increased in the surface layer (0–5 cm) and slightly declined in the lower layers. Changes in δ13C showed that C inputs were mainly located in the 0–18 cm layer. In contrast, SOC concentrations increased over time under semi-perennial crops throughout the old ploughed layer (ca. 0–33 cm). SOC stocks in the old ploughed layer increased significantly over time under semi-perennials with a mean increase of 0.93 ± 0.28 t C ha−1 yr−1, whereas no change occurred under perennial or annual crops. New SOC accumulation was higher for semi-perennial than for perennial crops (1.50 vs. 0.58 t C ha−1 yr−1, respectively), indicating that the SOC change was due to a variation in C input rather than a change in mineralization rate. Nitrogen fertilization rate had no significant effect on SOC stocks. This study highlights the interest of comparing SOC changes over time for various cropping systems.},

  abstract = {Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production from lipids is a technologically mature approach for replacing conventional fossil fuel use in the aviation sector, and there is increasing demand for such feedstocks. The oilseed Brassica carinata (known as Ethiopian mustard or simply carinata) is a promising SAF feedstock that can be grown as a supplemental cash crop over the winter fallow season of various annual crop rotations in the Southeast US, avoiding land use changes and potentially achieving some of the soil carbon sequestration and ecosystem service benefits of winter cover crops. However, carinata may require more intensive management than traditional cover crops, potentially leading to additional soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through increased carbon losses from soil tillage and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from nitrogen fertilizer application. In this work, the 2017 version of the process-based DayCent ecosystem model was used to establish initial expectations for the total regional SAF production potential and associated soil GHG emissions when carinata is integrated as a winter crop into the existing crop rotations across its current suitability range in southern Alabama, southern Georgia, and northern Florida. Using data from academic and industry carinata field trials in the region, DayCent was calibrated to reproduce carinata yield, nitrogen response, harvest index, and biomass carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. The resulting model was then used to simulate the integration of carinata every third winter across all 2.1~Mha of actively cultivated cropland in the study area. The model predicted regional average yields of 2.9–3.0~Mg carinata seed per hectare depending on crop management assumptions. That results in the production of more than two million Mg of carinata seed annually across the study area, enough to supply approximately one billion liters of SAF. Conventional management of carinata led to only modest increases in soil carbon storage that were largely offset by additional N2O emissions. Climate-smart management via adopting no-till carinata establishment or using poultry litter as a nitrogen source resulted in a substantial net soil GHG sink (0.23–0.31~Mg CO2e~ha−1~y−1, or 0.24–0.32~Mg CO2e per Mg of seed produced) at the farms where carinata is cultivated.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) balance is an important component of the terrestrial carbon (C) budget. However, effect of cropland management changes on SOC dynamics has not been recently assessed in the tropics. Studies were compiled in the tropics where SOC stocks were measured in the topsoil (0–20 or 0–30\,cm depth) after the adoption of management practices that are expected to enhance SOC stocks, including tillage reduction, crop rotation, exogenous organic amendments, restitution of crop residues, mineral amendments, and combinations of these practices. Random forest regression was used to identify the determinants of SOC accumulation rates (ΔSOC) depending on the climate, soil characteristics and changes in management practices. 214 cases were identified in 48 studies in 13 different countries. The average ΔSOC was 0.41\,±\,0.03\,Mg\,C ha−1\,yr−1 (significantly greater than zero), for an average experiment duration of 13.6\,±\,0.6\,years. Although a large part of the variability remained unexplained due to methodological bias in the studies or a lack of relevant predictors. The strongest predictors of ΔSOC were C inputs, duration of the experiments, and the management practices, whereas neither soil characteristics (soil type, clay content, and initial SOC stock) nor climate variables (mean annual temperature and rainfall, aridity index) affected ΔSOC. The SOC accumulation rates increased linearly with C inputs, and the conversion rate of C inputs to SOC was 8.2\,±\,0.8\%. Given the competing uses of organic matter on many tropical farms, the benefits of using changes in management practices for climate change mitigation might be overrated. As ΔSOC decreased with the duration of the experiments, ΔSOC would probably be smaller if a period of 20 years were considered, as recommended by the IPCC guidelines. The management practice with the greatest ΔSOC was diversified crop rotation. Cropping systems where diverse practices were combined resulted in higher ΔSOC than individual practices such as reduced tillage and mineral fertilization on their own. The adoption of improved management practices that increase C inputs is still relevant for meeting the challenges of food security and adaptation to climate change.},

In this study, we estimated the cost of carbon stored on an acre of afforested loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) over a 100-years simulation period in the Lower Coastal Plain Region of the Southern United States. We varied site indices, interest rates, and carbon discount rates for ascertaining the impacts on the cost of the total carbon stored across three carbon pools (stand, finished wood products, and wood present in landfills). After accounting for the net profits from an acre of afforested loblolly pine plantation, the cost of stored carbon currently ranges between \$0.76/ton and -\$10.12/ton over a 100-years simulation period with zero carbon discount rate. The cost of stored carbon is lower for higher site indices. The cost of stored carbon decreases with a rise in the carbon discount rate. Afforestation is a cost-effective nature-based solution for mitigating climate change. It should be considered as a potential strategy for reducing the overall cost of mitigating climate change in the United States. The findings of the study are relevant for efforts promoting afforestation as a tool for mitigating climate change worldwide.},

This study determined carbon allocation coefficients in grain, straw, roots, and rhizodeposits for important oilseed and pulse crops in comparison with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under low-water (rainfall only) and high-water (rainfall plus irrigation) conditions. Three oilseeds [canola (Brassica napus L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)], and three pulses [chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.)], along with a wheat control were tested in Saskatchewan, Canada, in 2006 and 2007. Crops were grown in 15-cm diameter, 100-cm long metal lysimeters pushed into the field of medium-textured Aridic Haploboroll with the soil structure in lysimeters undisturbed. Root mass in the 0–100cm depth was greater (P{$<$}0.01) under irrigation than that under rainfall for wheat (126\% greater), flax (54\% greater), and mustard (14\% greater); there was no difference for dry pea; and was lower (P{$<$}0.01) under irrigation for chickpea (−16\%) and lentil (−35\%). Straw-to-root ratio averaged 4.90 under rainfall conditions and 6.22 under irrigation; the ratio differed among crop species only under rainfall conditions where the ratios for wheat (6.33), dry pea (5.35) and mustard (5.00) were greater than the ratios for canola, chickpea, and lentil. The relative C allocation coefficients in grain (Rg), straw (Rs), roots in the 0–100cm depth (Rr), and rhizodeposits (Re), expressed as estimated C input from each plant part in proportion to total C, varied among crop species. On average, the allocation coefficient for pulse crops (Rg:Rs:Rr:Re) was 0.24:0.46:0.18:0.12 under low-water, and 0.31:0.47:0.14:0.09 under high-water conditions. For oilseeds, the corresponding values were 0.17:0.58:0.15:0.10 for low-water, and 0.19:0.56:0.15:0.10 for high-water conditions. These C allocation coefficients in oilseeds and pulses should provide modellers with essential tools in quantifying C dynamics and soil C sequestration for agricultural systems involving broadleaved crop species.},

In this paper, we show how to obtain a matched sample with balanced pretreatment variables for a dataset with multiple treatments. Using Generalized Boosted Models (GBMs) to calculate the generalized propensity score vector, our proposed procedure match observations on a multi-dimensional space.

Soils higher in organic C appear darker than surrounding soils in aerial imagery after tillage, although this difference is only relative without knowledge of the range of SOC. This range could be estimated from Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. To verify this, the SSURGO database was used to estimate the SOC range at three sites in central Iowa. Soil organic C content across each field was then linearly interpolated within the SSURGO-estimated range for each field using the brightness values at each pixel in the aerial photograph as a scaling factor. Measured SOC data from the three sites ranged from 3.4 to 50 g kg−1 and the R2 and RMSE values between the measured and estimated SOC concentrations ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 and 3.5 to 7.6 g kg−1, respectively. Limited thresholding of the brightest and darkest pixels improved the accuracy and precision of SOC estimates over raw imagery. These results imply that aerial imagery supplemented by SSURGO-estimated SOC ranges can provide georeferenced SOC estimates suitable for site-specific recommendations and analysis without field sampling.},

  abstract = {Uncertainties in soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are rarely quantified even though they are critical in determining the significance of the results. Previous studies on this topic generally focused on a single variable involved in the SOC stock calculation (SOC concentration, sampling depth, bulk density and rock fragment content) or on a single scale, rather than using an integrated approach (i.e. taking into account interactions between variables). This study aims to apply such an approach to identify and quantify the uncertainties in SOC stock assessments for different scales and spatial landscape units (LSU) under agriculture. The error propagation method (δ method) was used to quantify the relative contribution of each variable and interaction involved to the final SOC stock variability. Monte Carlo simulations were used to cross-check the results. Both methods converged (r2=0.78). As expected, the coefficient of variation of the SOC stock increased across scales (from 5 to 35\%), and was higher for grassland than for cropland. Although the main source of uncertainty in the SOC stock varied according to the scale and the LSU considered, the variability of SOC concentration (due to errors from the laboratory and to the high SOC spatial variability) and of the rock fragment content were predominant. When assessing SOC stock at the landscape scale, one should focus on the precision of SOC analyses from the laboratory, the reduction of SOC spatial variability (using bulk samples, accurate re-sampling, high sampling density or stratified sampling), and the use of equivalent masses for SOC stock comparison. The regional SOC stock monitoring of agricultural soils in southern Belgium allows the detection of an average SOC stock change of 20\% within 11 years if very high rates of SOC stock changes occur (1 t C ha–1 year–1). Amplitude et sources des incertitudes liées aux estimations des stocks de carbone organique dans le sol (COS) à différentes échelles Résumé Les erreurs associées aux estimations du stock de carbone organique dans le sol (COS) sont rarement quantifiées bien qu’elles puissent empêcher l’obtention de résultats significatifs. Les quelques études qui le font focalisent en général sur une seule variable nécessaire au calcul du stock de COS (concentration en COS, profondeur échantillonnée, densité apparente et contenu en fragments rocheux) ou sur une échelle spatiale particulière, sans utiliser d’approche intégrée (prenant en compte les interactions entre les variables). Cette étude a pour objectif d’utiliser une telle approche pour identifier et quantifier les incertitudes liées aux estimations de stock de COS à différentes échelles spatiales et pour diverses unités spatiales de paysages (USP) agricoles. La loi de propagation des erreurs (méthode δ) permet de quantifier la contribution relative de chaque variable et interaction à la variabilité finale du stock de COS. Les simulations de Monte Carlo sont utilisées pour la vérification croisée des résultats. Les deux méthodes ont convergé (r2= 0.78). Comme prévu, le coefficient de variation du stock de COS a proportionnellement augmenté avec l’échelle spatiale considérée (de 5 à 35\%), et était plus élevé pour les cultures que pour les prairies. Bien que la principale source d’erreur sur le stock de COS soit fonction de l’échelle spatiale et du type d’USP considérés, la variabilité du contenu en COS (du fait des erreurs de laboratoire et de sa grande variabilité spatiale) et du contenu en fragments rocheux étaient prédominants. Lors de l’estimation des stocks de COS à l’échelle du paysage, l’attention devrait prioritairement porter sur la précision des analyses en COS du laboratoire, la réduction de la variabilité spatiale du COS (en utilisant des échantillons composites, un ré-échantillonnage précis, une densité d’échantillonnage élevée ou un échantillonnage stratifié), et sur l’utilisation de masses équivalentes pour comparer les stocks de COS. Le réseau régional de suivi des stocks de COS des sols agricoles dans le sud de la Belgique permet la détection d’un changement de stock de COS moyen de 20\% en 11 ans pour un taux très élevé de changement en stock de COS (1 t C ha–1 year–1).},

  abstract = {Recent research has shed light on the cost-effective contribution that agriculture can make to global greenhouse gas abatement; however, the resulting impacts on agricultural production, producer livelihoods, and food security remain largely unexplored. This paper provides an integrated assessment of the linkages between land-based climate policies, development, and food security, with a particular emphasis on abatement opportunities and impacts in the livestock sector. Targeting Annex I countries and exempting non-Annex I countries from land-based carbon policies on equity or food security grounds may result in significant leakage rates for livestock production and agriculture as a whole. We find that such leakage can be eliminated by supplying forest carbon sequestration incentives to non-Annex I countries. Furthermore, substantial additional global agricultural abatement can be attained by extending a greenhouse gas emissions tax to non-Annex I agricultural producers, while compensating them for their additional tax expenses. Because of their relatively large emissions intensities and limited abatement possibilities, ruminant meat producers face the greatest market adjustments to land-based climate policies. We also evaluate the impacts of climate policies on livelihoods and food consumption in developing countries. In the absence of non-Annex I abatement policies, these impacts are modest. However, strong income and food consumption impacts surface because of higher food costs after forest carbon sequestration is promoted at a global scale. Food consumption among unskilled labor households falls but rises for the representative farm households, because global agricultural supplies are restricted and farm prices rise sharply in the face of inelastic food demands.},

  abstract = {The USA accounts for 38 and 35\% of global maize and soybean production, producing a respective 320 and 84 Mt of these crops annually. More than 85\% of those totals are produced in the north-central region known as the ‘Corn Belt’, where continuous maize and 2-year maize–soybean rotation are the dominant cropping systems. This chapter describes the climate, soil, and management practices of high-yield maize–soybean cropping systems in the Corn Belt. Major drivers for higher yields and resource-use efficiency are evaluated and opportunities for further improvement are discussed. Yield and input-use efficiency of maize and soybean in the US Corn Belt have increased steadily during the last 40 years as a result of (1) continuous genetic improvement, (2) intermittently phased periods of agronomic improvement, and (3) the synergistic interaction of improved genetics and agronomy. Future increases may be difficult to achieve as on-farm yields approach yield potential; however, some of the yield gap between on-farm yield and simulated yield potential can still be captured by fine-tuning crop management in a manner that increases yield, while simultaneously reducing the resource input amount or cost. Indeed, substantive opportunities exist for increased input-use efficiency by scheduling just-in-time irrigation events of the minimum amount needed, and by optimizing management of N fertilizer to be temporally and spatially effective.},

  abstract = {Land management and land cover change exert a strong influence on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. As scientific, political, and business communities increase their awareness of the essential roles SOC plays in climate regulation and ecosystem functions, efforts to quantify the impacts of land use and management on SOC have increased rapidly. Existing methods of estimating SOC stocks from widely available data do not account for land cover, and are therefore of limited usefulness in understanding the impacts of past and future land use change. This project explores a method of linking land cover to SOC using data from public datasets and the scientific literature, to provide an SOC Inventory for Massachusetts, and compares the results to those derived from a common baseline approach. Our method derives average land cover SOC values by combining data from the USDA-NRCS Rapid Carbon Assessment and the National Cooperative Soil Characterization Database with values from a meta-analysis of scientific literature. These are applied to the total area of the 20 most abundant land cover classes of Massachusetts. We compare this land cover-based approach with a baseline using SOC values found in the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), applied to each soil map unit found within Massachusetts. Our approach produced an estimated stock of 481 million metric tons of SOC, 29\% and 109 million metric tons greater than the SSURGO baseline. We use these estimates to explore the use of the land cover based SOC values to project the impacts of likely land cover change by 2050.},

We present the results of an automated system used across 645 counties in the United States Corn Belt from 2005 to 2018, mapped at field-scale and summarized for distribution at aggregated scales. Large-scale mapping by OpTIS (Operational Tillage Information System), a software tool that analyzes remotely sensed data of agricultural land, provides trends of conservation tillage (defined as {$>$}30\% residue cover), cover cropping, and crop rotations, while modeling by DNDC (Denitrification–Decomposition), a process-based model of carbon and biogeochemistry in soil, provides estimates of the ecosystem outcomes associated with the changes in management practices mapped by OpTIS. Ground-truthing data acquired via OpTIS mobile, a roadside field-surveying app, were used for verification in 30 counties. OpTIS results for the Corn Belt show adoption of cover crops after planting corn and soy increased from 1\% to 3\% of the mapped area when comparing 2006 to 2018. Comparison of trends for conservation tillage use from 2006 to 2018 shows a slight decrease in conservation tillage adoption, from 46\% to 44\%. Results from DNDC show these soils sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) at an area-weighted mean change in SOC (dSOC) rate of 161 kgC/ha/year. Comparatively, in a scenario modeled without the adoption of soil health management practices, the same soils would have lost SOC at an area-weighted rate of −65 kgC/ha/year. As many factors affect changes to SOC, including climate and initial SOC in soils, modeling counterfactual scenarios at the field scale demonstrates outcomes of current soil health management in comparison to regional management practices and best management practices, with respect to SOC sequestration. Regional trends in adoption rates of conservation agriculture and resulting soil health implications are of great use for a wide range of stakeholders. We demonstrate the capability of OpTIS remote sensing to deliver robust, large-scale, multi-sensor, ground-verified monitoring data of current and historical adoption of conservation practices, and of DNDC process-based modeling to provide assessments of the associated environmental outcomes across regions in U.S. cropland.},

The key driver of land-use change in the model is county-level measures of net returns to five major land uses. The net returns are modified for the IPCC scenarios according to assumed trends in population and income and projections from integrated assessment models of agricultural prices and agricultural and forestry yields. For both scenarios, we project large increases in urban land by the middle of the century, while the largest declines are in cropland area. Significant differences among regions in the projected patterns of land-use change are evident, including an expansion of forests in the Mountain and Plains regions with declines elsewhere. Comparisons to projections with no climate change effects on prices and yields reveal relatively small differences. Thus, our findings suggest that future land-use patterns in the U.S. will be shaped largely by urbanization, with climate change having a relatively small influence.},

Although both prescribed and wildland fires are common in temperate forests of North America, few studies have addressed the long-term influence of such disturbances on the soil microflora in these ecosystems. Fire alters the soil microbial community structure in the short-term primarily through heat-induced microbial mortality. Over the long-term, fire may modify soil communities by altering plant community composition via plant-induced changes in the soil environment. In this review, we summarize and synthesize the various studies that have assessed the effects of fire on forest soil microorganisms, emphasizing the mechanisms by which fire impacts these vital ecosystem engineers. The examples used in this paper are derived primarily from studies of ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the Inland West of the USA; these forests have some of the shortest historical fire-return intervals of any forest type, and thus the evolutionary role of fire in shaping these forests is likely the strongest. We argue that the short-term effects of fire on soil microflora and the processes they catalyze are transient, and suggest that more research be devoted to linking long-term plant community responses with those of the mutually dependent soil microflora.},

  abstract = {Land has long been overlooked in economics. That is now changing. A substantial part of the solution to the climate crisis may lie in growing crops for fuel and using trees for storing carbon. This book investigates the potential of these options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, estimates the costs to the economy, and analyses the trade-offs with growing food. The first part presents new databases that are necessary to underpin policy-relevant research in the field of climate change while describing and critically assessing the underlying data, the methodologies used, and the first applications.  Together, the new data and the extended models allow for a thorough and comprehensive analysis of a land use and climate policy. This book outlines key empirical and analytical issues associated with modelling land use and land use change in the context of global climate change policy. It places special emphasis on the economy-wide competition for land and other resources, especially;   The implications of changes in land use for the cost of climate change mitigation,    Land use change as a result of mitigation, and    Feedback from changes in the global climate to land use.  By offering synthesis and evaluation of a variety of different approaches to this challenging field of research, this book will serve as a key reference for future work in the economic analysis of land use and climate change policy.},

A study conducted from 2002 to 2005 by USDA-ARS and the Univ. of GA assessed the effects of cover crops on soil physical properties and C/N relationships in a sandy coastal plain soil. The cropping systems were (A) sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), sweet corn (Zea mays L.); (B) sunn hemp, fallow, sweet corn; (C) fallow, crimson clover, sweet corn; (D) fallow, fallow, sweet corn; or (E) fallow, fallow, fallow. Three N rates (0, 67, or 133kgha−1) were tested on the corn for cropping systems A, B, and C, while N rates of 0, 67, 133, 200, and 267kgha−1 were used for cropping system D. No N was applied to cropping system E. Soil physical property measurements made on minimally disturbed cores (7.6cm height×7.6cm diameter) collected from the top 7.6cm both within the row and interrow of each plot seven times during the study included bulk density (BD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and volumetric soil moisture content (θ) over a range of matric suctions. Carbon/nitrogen levels were determined from samples of the top 2.5cm of soil collected quarterly. Three year mean biomass added to the soil from sunn hemp ranged from 6.9 to 9.8Mgha−1, while that from crimson clover ranged from 3.3 to 5.0Mgha−1. The input of cover crop biomass increased soil C (0.3–4.7mgg−1) and N (0.1–0.5mgg−1), which contributed to improvements in soil structure and fertility. Significantly greater C (2.2mgg−1 vs. 1.8mgg−1), lower BD (1.71Mgm−3 vs. 1.73Mgm−3) and greater θ at field capacity (0.126 vs. 0.113cm3cm−3) were found in the rotations with sunn hemp as crop 1 as compared to rotations with fallow as crop 1. There were significant differences in BD, Ks, and θ between soil in the rows and that in the interrows for all treatments. In general, BD were lower, Ks were greater, and θ were greater in the rows than in the interrows. Overall the study indicated that high residue input from fall and winter cover crops is important for adding C, retaining plant-available N in organic matter, increasing fertilizer use efficiency, and improving soil physical properties in the very sandy soils of the southeastern (SE) USA coastal plain region.},

We assessed crop sequence and tillage effects on SOC dynamics and storage using natural 13C abundance of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.), Merr.]. Treatments consisted of tillage: moldboard plow (MP), chisel plow (CP), and no-tillage (NT); and crop sequence: continuous corn (CC), continuous soybean (SS), and alternating corn–soybean (CS). Soil samples were collected after 14 yr in each treatment and in fallow alley-ways and were analyzed for SOC, δ13C, bulk density, and pH. Tillage by crop sequence interactions occurred as treatments with MP and SS as well as fallow averaged 135 Mg SOC ha−1 (0- to 45-cm depth), while CP treatments with corn (CC and CS) and NT with CC averaged 164 Mg SOC ha−1 Crop sequence effects on SOC (0- to 45-cm depth) occurred when tillage was reduced with CP and NT averaging 15\% greater SOC in CC than SS. In addition to less C inputs than CC, SS accelerated rates of SOC decomposition. Tillage effects on SOC were greatest in CC where CP had 26\% and NT 20\% more SOC than MP, whereas SOC in SS was similar across tillage treatments. Up to 33\% of the greater SOC under CC for CP and NT, compared with MP, occurred below tillage operating depths. Substantial losses of SOC were estimated (1.6 Mg SOC ha−1 yr−1) despite lowering SOC decay rates with reduced tillage and high levels of C inputs with CC.},

  abstract = {Landsat Thematic Mapper has been collecting multispectral imagery at 30\,m resolution globally since 1984. One utility of the data has been for detailed mapping of agricultural regions and seasonal identification of crops grown within them. However, the ability to do so has only been applied sporadically and eluded widespread adoption due to cost of the imagery, burdensome preprocessing requirements, and computing not being up to the task. These hurdles have become much reduced of recent with the free and open distribution of the Landsat imagery, emphasis on ready-to-use surface reflectance data products, and distributed high performance computing infrastructures available online in “the cloud.” As such, this work leverages these aspects and investigates the ability to retrospectively map summer crops over the United States (US) annually from 1984 to 2007. Google's Earth Engine Internet-based analytical platform containing the historical Landsat archive in surface reflectance format was used as a foundation for the classification work. Robust 30\,m Cropland Data Layer (CDL) information from US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for years 2008 through 2011 were leveraged to train rule-based classifiers which were applied back through time to each year 1984 through 2007. Focus crops were corn, soybeans, and winter wheat – the three largest by area in the US. A large sampling of highly intensive counties throughout the country were prototyped for generation of the 24\,years of historical crop cover. For validation, crop area statistics were calculated for each county-year and compared to survey-based information existing from the USDA. Results were muted overall with the average crop area coefficient of determination (R2) correlations for the years 1984–2007 found to be 0.192, 0.159, and 0.142 for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat, respectively. Furthermore, the standard deviations were variable at 0.132, 0.177, and 0.133, also respectively. While unimpressive, it was found as a benchmark that the R2 between the 2008 through 2017 CDL classifications were only 0.478, 0.686, and 0.726 and thus a suggestion that the USDA area statistics are an imperfect measure of map accuracy. Deletion of approximately one third to one half of the grossest 1984–2007 outlier years from the historical outputs pulled the correlations to the benchmark standard. Qualitatively, most of the remaining years classified looked of high quality and were believed useful as field-level thematic crop area maps. These historical cropland maps could provide the ability to better detail the role farming has played on the broad US landscape over recent decades.},

  abstract = {Designing landscapes that can meet human needs, while maintaining functioning ecosystems, is essential for long-term sustainability. To achieve this goal, we must better understand the trade-offs and thresholds in the provision of ecosystem services and economic returns. To this end, we integrate spatially explicit economic and biophysical models to jointly optimize agricultural profit (sugarcane production and cattle ranching), biodiversity (bird and mammal species), and freshwater quality (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment retention) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We generate efficiency frontiers to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs and map efficient combinations of agricultural land and natural habitat under varying service importance. To assess the potential impact of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC), a federal policy that aims to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services on private lands, we compare the frontiers with optimizations that mimic the habitat requirements in the region. We find significant opportunities to improve both economic and environmental outcomes relative to the current landscape. Substantial trade-offs between biodiversity and water quality exist when land use planning targets a single service, but these trade-offs can be minimized through multi-objective planning. We also detect non-linear profit-ecosystem services relationships that result in land use thresholds that coincide with the FC requirements. Further, we demonstrate that landscape-level planning can greatly improve the performance of the FC relative to traditional farm-level planning. These findings suggest that through joint planning for economic and environmental goals at a landscape-scale, Brazil's agricultural sector can expand production and meet regulatory requirements, while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.},

  abstract = {Spatial patterns and total amounts of soil organic C (SOC) are important data for studies of soil productivity, soil hydraulic properties, and the cycling of C-based greenhouse gases. This study evaluated several approaches for characterizing SOC to determine their relative merits. The first approach entailed grouping data from a global pedon SOC database by type of ecosystem, resulting in a total of 78.0 Pg of C (Pg = 1015 g) to 1-m depth for the contiguous USA. In a second approach, a pedon database was aggregated using soil taxonomy, resulting in a total for the contiguous USA of 80.7 ± 18.6 Pg of C when the great group SOC was spatially distributed with Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) using the 1982 National Resource Inventory (NRI) and the Soil Interpretation Record databases. The third approach used pedon and spatial data from a global soil map grouped by soil unit that resulted in 84.5 Pg of C for the contiguous USA. Although the ecosystem and soil taxonomic approaches resulted in similar totals, the taxonomic approaches are recommended because they gave more realistic results in areas of Histosols, shallow soils, and soils with high rock fragment content. The ecosystem approach did not give reliable spatial patterns and is only useful for very broad-scale work where precisely georeferenced data are not needed. Grouping data by great group provided more information than grouping by order or suborder. The approach based on soil taxonomy is very useful because it is based on the NRI statistical framework and it allows stratification by other NRI items, such as land use and vegetation.},

  abstract = {Intensive use of N fertilizers in modern agriculture is motivated by the economic value of high grain yields and is generally perceived to sequester soil organic C by increasing the input of crop residues. This perception is at odds with a century of soil organic C data reported herein for the Morrow Plots, the world's oldest experimental site under continuous corn (Zea mays L.). After 40 to 50 yr of synthetic fertilization that exceeded grain N removal by 60 to 190\%, a net decline occurred in soil C despite increasingly massive residue C incorporation, the decline being more extensive for a corn-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) or corn-oats (Avena sativa L.)-hay rotation than for continuous corn and of greater intensity for the profile (0-46 cm) than the surface soil. These findings implicate fertilizer N in promoting the decomposition of crop residues and soil organic matter and are consistent with data from numerous cropping experiments involving synthetic N fertilization in the USA Corn Belt and elsewhere, although not with the interpretation usually provided. There are important implications for soil C sequestration because the yield-based input of fertilizer N has commonly exceeded grain N removal for corn production on fertile soils since the 1960s. To mitigate the ongoing consequences of soil deterioration, atmospheric CO(2) enrichment, and NO(3)(-) pollution of ground and surface waters, N fertilization should be managed by site-specific assessment of soil N availability. Current fertilizer N management practices, if combined with corn stover removal for bioenergy production, exacerbate soil C loss.},

  abstract = {To assess differences in the lag-effect pattern in the relationship between particulate matter less than 10~μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and cause-specific mortality in Seoul, Korea, from January 1995 to December 1999, we performed a time-series analysis. We used a generalized additive Poisson regression model to control for time trends, temperature, humidity, air pressure, and the day of the week. The PM10 effect was estimated on the basis of the time-series models using the 24-h means and the quadratic distributed-lag models using a cumulative 6-day effect. One interquartile range increase in the 6-day cumulative mean of PM10 (43.12~µg/m3) was associated with an increase in non-accidental deaths [3.7\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.1, 5.4], respiratory disease (13.9\%, 95\% CI: 6.8, 21.5), cardiovascular disease (4.4\%, 95\% CI: –1.0, 9.0), and cerebrovascular disease (6.3\%, 95\% CI: 2.3, 10.5). We found the following patterns in the disease-specific lag-effect window: respiratory mortality was more affected by air pollution level on the day of death, whereas cardiovascular deaths were more affected by the previous day's air pollution level. Cerebrovascular deaths were simultaneously associated with the air pollution levels of the same day and the previous day. The patterns in the lag effect from the distributed-lag models were similar to those of a series of time-series models with 24-h means. These results contribute to our understanding of how exposure to air pollution causes adverse health effects.},

Our objective was to assess CC treatment and planting practice effects on CC biomass, spring soil nitrate concentrations, and soybean yield at two rainfed sites in eastern and one irrigated site in south-central Nebraska over 4 yr. Cover crop treatments (cereal rye [Secale cereale L.] [RYE] and a mix of rye, legume, and brassica species [MIX]) were planted by broadcast interseeding into corn stands in September (pre-harvest broadcast) or drilling after corn harvest (post-harvest drilled) and terminated 2 wk before planting soybean. Cover crop biomass and N uptake varied between years, but generally at the eastern sites, pre-harvest broadcasting produced more biomass than post-harvest drilling (1.64 and 0.79 Mg ha−1, respectively) and had greater N uptake (37 and 24 kg ha−1, respectively). At the south-central site, post-harvest drilling produced more than pre-harvest broadcasting (1.44 and 1.20 Mg ha−1, respectively). RYE had more biomass than MIX (1.41 and 1.09 Mg ha−1, respectively), but the same N uptake. Soil nitrate reductions after CC were small. In 3 of 12 site-years, soybean yielded less after pre-harvest CC. Yield reductions were not correlated to CC biomass, but were likely due to greater weed pressure. High CC productivity is necessary for high N uptake, and requires site-specific selection of planting practice and CC treatments.},

  abstract = {Growing cover or winter crops and retaining crop residue on agricultural lands are considered beneficial management practices to address soil health and water quality. Remote sensing is a valuable tool to assess and map crop residue cover and cover crops. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of linear spectral unmixing for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season (November–May) over the Canadian Lake Erie Basin using seasonal multitemporal satellite imagery. Soil cover ground measurements and multispectral Landsat-8 imagery were acquired for two areas throughout the 2015–2016 non-growing season. Vertical soil cover photos were collected from up to 40 residue and 30 cover crop fields for each area (e.g., Elgin and Essex sites) when harvest, cloud, and snow conditions permitted. Images and data were reviewed and compiled to represent a complete coverage of the basin for three time periods (post-harvest, pre-planting, and post-planting). The correlations between field measured and satellite imagery estimated soil covers (e.g., residue and green) were evaluated by coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Overall, spectral unmixing of satellite imagery is well suited for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season. Spectral unmixing using three-endmembers (i.e., corn residue-soil-green cover; soybean residue-soil-green cover) showed higher correlations with field measured soil cover than spectral unmixing using two- or four-endmembers. For the nine non-growing season images analyzed, the residue and green cover fractions derived from linear spectral unmixing using corn residue-soil-green cover endmembers were highly correlated with the field-measured data (mean R2 of 0.70 and 0.86, respectively). The results of this study support the use of remote sensing and spectral unmixing techniques for monitoring performance metrics for government initiatives, such as the Canada-Ontario Lake Erie Action Plan, and as input for sustainability indicators that both require knowledge about non-growing season land management over a large area.},

About 60 to 70\% of the C thus depleted can be resequestered through adoption of recommended soil and crop management practices. These practices include conversion from plow till to no till, frequent use of winter cover crops in the rotation cycle, elimination of summer fallow, integrated nutrient management along with liberal use of biosolids and biological nitrogen fixation, precision farming to minimize losses and enhance fertilizer use efficiency, and use of improved varieties with ability to produce large root biomass with high content of lignin and suberin. The gross rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration ranges from 500 to 800 kg/ha/year in cold and humid regions and 100 to 300 kg/ha/year in dry and warm regions. The rate of SOC sequestration can be measured with procedures that are cost effective and credible at soil pedon level, landscape level, regional or national scale. In addition to SOC, there is also a large potential to sequester soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in arid and semi-arid regions. Soil C sequestration has numerous ancillary benefits. It is truly a win-win situation: extremely cost-effective, and a bridge to the future until alternative energy options take effect.},

  abstract = {World soils and terrestrial ecosystems have been a source of atmospheric abundance of CO2 ever since settled agriculture began about 10–13~millennia ago. The amount of CO2-C emitted into the atmosphere is estimated at 136~±~55~Pg from terrestrial ecosystems, of which emission from world soils is estimated at 78~±~12~Pg. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems decreases soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by 30–50\% over 50–100~years in temperate regions, and 50–75\% over 20–50~years in tropical climates. The projected global warming, with estimated increase in mean annual temperature of 4–6°C by 2100, may have a profound impact on the total soil C pool and its dynamics. The SOC pool may increase due to increase in biomass production and accretion into the soil due to the so-called “CO2 fertilization effect”, which may also enhance production of the root biomass. Increase in weathering of silicates due to increase in temperature, and that of the formation of secondary carbonates due to increase in partial pressure of CO2 in soil air may also increase the total C pool. In contrast, however, SOC pool may decrease because of: (i) increase in rate of respiration and mineralization, (ii) increase in losses by soil erosion, and (iii) decrease in protective effects of stable aggregates which encapsulate organic matter. Furthermore, the relative increase in temperature projected to be more in arctic and boreal regions, will render Cryosols under permafrost from a net sink to a net source of CO2 if and when permafrost thaws. Thus, SOC pool of world soils may decrease with increase in mean global temperature. In contrast, the biotic pool may increase primarily because of the CO2 fertilization effect. The magnitude of CO2 fertilization effect may be constrained by lack of essential nutrients (e.g., N, P) and water. The potential of SOC sequestration in agricultural soils of Europe is 70–190~Tg~C~yr−1. This potential is realizable through adoption of recommended land use and management, and restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems including wetlands.},

  abstract = {Monitoring agricultural land is important for understanding and managing food production, environmental conservation efforts, and climate change. The United States Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL), an annual satellite imagery-derived land cover map, has been increasingly used for this application since complete coverage of the conterminous United States became available in 2008. However, the CDL is designed and produced with the intent of mapping annual land cover rather than tracking changes over time, and as a result certain precautions are needed in multi-year change analyses to minimize error and misapplication. We highlight scenarios that require special considerations, suggest solutions to key challenges, and propose a set of recommended good practices and general guidelines for CDL-based land change estimation. We also characterize a problematic issue of crop area underestimation bias within the CDL that needs to be accounted for and corrected when calculating changes to crop and cropland areas. When used appropriately and in conjunction with related information, the CDL is a valuable and effective tool for detecting diverse trends in agriculture. By explicitly discussing the methods and techniques for post-classification measurement of land-cover and land-use change using the CDL, we aim to further stimulate the discourse and continued development of suitable methodologies. Recommendations generated here are intended specifically for the CDL but may be broadly applicable to additional remotely-sensed land cover datasets including the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land cover products, and other regional, national, and global land cover classification maps.},

  abstract = {Climate change is exacerbating environmental pollution from crop production. Spatially and temporally explicit estimates of life-cycle environmental impacts are therefore needed for suggesting location and time relevant environmental mitigations strategies. Emission factors and process-based mechanism models are popular approaches used to estimate life-cycle environmental impacts. However, emission factors are often incapable of describing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of agricultural emissions, whereas process-based mechanistic models, capable of capturing the heterogeneity, tend to be very complicated and time-consuming. Efficient prediction of life-cycle environmental impacts from agricultural production is lacking. This study develops a rapid predictive model to quantify life-cycle global warming (GW) and eutrophication (EU) impacts of corn production using a novel machine learning approach. We used the boosted regression tree (BRT) model to estimate future life-cycle environmental impacts of corn production in U.S. Midwest counties under four emissions scenarios for years 2022–2100. Results from BRT models indicate that the cross-validation (R2) for predicting life cycle GW and EU impacts ranged from 0.78 to 0.82, respectively. Furthermore, results show that future life-cycle GW and EU impacts of corn production will increase in magnitude under all four emissions scenarios, with the highest environmental impacts shown under the high-emissions scenario. Moreover, this study found that changes in precipitation and temperature played a significant role in influencing the spatial heterogeneity in all life-cycle impacts across Midwest counties. The BRT model results indicate that machine learning can be a useful tool for predicting spatially and temporally explicit future life-cycle environmental impacts associated with corn production under different climate scenarios.},

  abstract = {In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a life-cycle analysis of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production and combustion of corn ethanol. EPA projected that by 2022, the emissions profile of corn ethanol from a new refinery would be 21\% lower than that of an energy equivalent quantity of gasoline. Since 2010, the 21\% value has dominated policy discussions and federal regulations related to corn ethanol as a renewable fuel and a GHG mitigation option. It is now 2018 and new data, scientific studies, technical reports, and other information allow us to examine the emissions pathway corn-ethanol has actually followed since 2010. Using this information, we assess corn ethanol's current GHG profile at 39–43\% lower than gasoline. We also develop two projected emissions scenarios for corn ethanol in 2022. These scenarios highlight opportunities to produce ethanol with emissions that are 47.0–70.0\% lower than gasoline. Many countries are now developing or revising renewable energy policies. Typically, biofuel substitutes for gasoline are required to reduce GHG emissions by more than 21\%. Our results could help position U.S. corn ethanol to compete in these new and growing markets.},

  abstract = {Understanding long-term management effects on soil properties is necessary to determine the relative sustainability of cropping systems. Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties were measured in a long-term cropping system study in the Western Corn Belt. Properties were evaluated after 16 yr in four crop sequences [continuous corn (zea mays L.) (CC), corn–soybean [Glycine max. (L.)] (C–SB), corn–oat (Avena sativa L.) + clover (80\% sweet clover [Melilotus officinalis L.] and 20\% red clover [Trifolium pratense L.])–grain sorghum [(Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)–soybean (C–OCL–SG–SB), and corn–soybean-grain sorghum–oat + clover (C–SB–SG–OCL)] each at three N fertilization rates (ZERO, LOW, and HIGH) to a soil depth of 30.5 cm on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls). Nitrogen fertilization had a greater impact on soil properties than crop sequence, with management effects most pronounced at 0 to 7.6 cm. Increased N rate resulted in greater organic C, total N, and particulate organic matter (POM), but lower soil pH. Increased N rate also reduced microbial biomass by ∼20\% between the HIGH and ZERO N-rate treatments. The C–SB–SG–OCL sequence possessed more potentially mineralizable N (PMN) (57 vs. 46 kg ha−1 for average of CC and C–SB) and a higher percentage of POM present as soil organic matter (17.1\% for the C–SB–SG–OCL sequence vs. 13.9\% for other sequences). Within the context of soil functions and cropping system performance, results from this study indicate the C–SB–SB–OCL sequence enhanced nutrient cycling efficiency, while N fertilization resulted in a trade-off between its positive effect on biological productivity and negative effect on nutrient cycling efficiency.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is one of the most important carbon (C) reservoirs on the Earth and plays a vital role in the global climate change. However, SOC stock at a regional scale is still uncertain due to the lack of soil bulk density data, differences in sample depth, geography, and soil properties. Based on data from 78 soil profiles, we estimated SOC density (SOCD) and its distribution at 0–100\,cm depth of croplands in three typical Counties (Lindian, Hailun and Baoqing Counties) in Northeast China. Soil organic carbon content and variations significantly decreased with increased soil depth. The SOCD in 100-cm depth ranged from 52.3 to 323.1\,Mg\,ha−1, with an average of 163.6\,Mg\,ha−1. The SOCD in the top 20\,cm accounted for 32.8\% of that in 100\,cm soil profile. A good mathematical equation between SOCD of 0–20\,cm and 0–100\,cm would be a useful tool to estimate SOCD in soil profiles. In addition, soil depth, bulk density, soil pH, and elevation were significantly correlated with SOC content. Regression of SOC in the data set to individual factors (soil depth, BD, soil pH, clay content, and elevation) is relevant to understand how C changes over time and depth.},

  abstract = {In the face of climate change and more frequent extreme weather, increasing crop resilience to weather anomaly has become a critical issue. This study explores the relationship between conservation practices (cover crop, no-tillage) and the resilience of corn and soybean to extreme precipitation, based on county-level data from the U.S. Corn Belt from 2005 to 2018. Crop insurance indemnities reflect crop losses and therefore reflect crop resilience. The research constructs three county- and year-fixed-effect regression models. Regression results show that as the degrees of weather extremes increases, the crop indemnities increase in general. When the interaction of extreme weather and conservation practices is taken into consideration, the relationships between conservation practices and indemnity level are not consistent, and they are based on the degree of weather anomaly. Corn cover crop acres are negatively correlated with the corn indemnity regardless of the precipitation level, and the soybean no-tillage acres are positively correlated with the soybean indemnity regardless of the precipitation level. However, for the corn no-tillage practices and the soybean cover crop practices, only when the precipitation is close to an average level do they negatively correlate with their corresponding crop indemnity levels. The capacity and resilience cultivation effect of conservation practices may vary across different crops and practices.},

In this setting, matching, subclassification, imputation, or inverse probability weighting on the propensity score can reduce the initial covariate bias between the treatment and control groups. With more than two treatment options, however, estimation of causal effects requires additional assumptions and techniques, the implementations of which have varied across disciplines. This paper reviews current methods, and it identifies and contrasts the treatment effects that each one estimates. Additionally, we propose possible matching techniques for use with multiple, nominal categorical treatments, and use simulations to show how such algorithms can yield improved covariate similarity between those in the matched sets, relative the pre-matched cohort. To sum, this manuscript provides a synopsis of how to notate and use causal methods for categorical treatments.},

  abstract = {Long-term soil carbon (C) dynamics in agro-ecosystems is controlled by interactions of climate, soil and agronomic management. A modeling approach is a useful tool to understand the interactions, especially over long climatic sequences. In this paper, we examine the performance of the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to predict the long-term soil C dynamics under various agricultural practices at four semi-arid sites across the wheat-belt of eastern Australia. We further assessed the underlying factors that regulate soil C dynamics in the top 30cm of soil through scenario analysis using the validated model. The results show that APSIM is able to predict aboveground biomass production and soil C dynamics at the study sites. Scenario analyses indicate that nitrogen (N) fertilization combined with residue retention (SR) has the potential to significantly slow or reverse the loss of C from agricultural soils. Optimal N fertilization (Nopt) and 100\% SR, increased soil C by 13\%, 46\% and 45\% at Warra, Wagga Wagga and Tarelee, respectively. Continuous lucerne pasture was the most efficient strategy to accumulate soil C, resulting in increases of 49\%, 57\% and 50\% at Warra, Wagga Wagga and Tarlee, respectively. In contrast, soil C decreases regardless of agricultural practices as a result of cultivation of natural soils at the Brigalow site. Soil C input, proportional to the amount of retained residue, is a significant predictor of soil C change. At each site, water and nitrogen availability and their interaction, explain more than 59\% of the variation in soil C. Across the four sites, mean air temperature has significant (P{$<$}0.05) effects on soil C change. There was greater soil C loss at sites with higher temperature. Our simulations suggest that detailed information on agricultural practices, land use history and local environmental conditions must be explicitly specified to be able to make plausible predictions of the soil C balance in agro-ecosystems at different agro-ecological scales.},

  abstract = {Innovative, open, and rapid methods to map crop types over large areas are needed for long-term cropland monitoring. We developed two novel and automated decision tree classification approaches to map crop types across the conterminous United States (U.S.) using MODIS 250m resolution data: 1) generalized, and 2) year-specific classification. The classification approaches use similarities and dissimilarities in crop type phenology derived from NDVI time-series data for the two approaches. The year-specific approach uses the training samples from one year and classifies crop types for that year only, whereas the generalized classification approach uses above-average, average, and below-average precipitation years for training to produce crop type maps for one or multiple years more robustly. We produced annual crop type maps using the generalized classification approach for 2001–2014 and the year-specific approach for 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The year-specific classification had overall accuracies {$>$}78\%, while the generalized classifier had accuracies {$>$}75\% for the conterminous U.S. for 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The generalized classifier enables automated and routine crop type mapping without repeated and expensive ground sample collection year after year. The resulting crop type maps for years prior to 2007 are new and especially important for long-term cropland monitoring and food security analysis because no other map products are currently available for 2001–2007.},

The response of SOCs to crop types is yet to be determined under different environments. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the impact of crop type on the allocation of atmospheric C to shoots and roots, and ultimately to the soils and to determine its association with soil carbon stocks. Three hundred and eighty-nine field trials were compared to determine allocation of biomass and C in plants and SOCs under fields of different crop types. Grasses had the highest plant biomass production (19.80±1.16Mgha−1yr−1), followed by cereals (9.44±0.45Mgha−1yr−1), fibre (7.90±1.00Mgha−1yr−1), legumes (3.29±0.63Mgha−1yr−1), and oil crops (3.05±1.16Mgha−1yr−1) showing significant differences (p{$<$}0.05). Maize (6.3±0.34 MgCha−1yr−1) had the highest plant C amongst summer crops, while wheat (2.2±0.35MgCha−1yr−1) had the highest plant C amongst winter crops. In all the studies, crops allocated more C to their shoots than roots yielding root C: shoot C (Rc/Sc) ratios below magnitude. The greatest C allocation to roots was in grasses (Rc/Sc=1.19±0.08), followed by cereals (0.95±0.03), legumes (0.86±0.04), oil crops (0.85±0.08), and fibre crops (0.50±0.07). There was evidence that high plant C stocks were found in crops grown under carbon rich clayey soils of tropical humid areas. Natural grasses and cereals should be promoted as they appeared to yield greater potential for atmospheric carbon sequestration in plants and soils. Overall, the study evaluated the relative potential of the main crop types to sequester atmospheric C useful in screening of crop types for carbon efficiency and for development of plant C models.},

  abstract = {The use of propensity scores to control for pretreatment imbalances on observed variables in non-randomized or observational studies examining the causal effects of treatments or interventions has become widespread over the past decade. For settings with two conditions of interest such as a treatment and a control, inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation with propensity scores estimated via boosted models has been shown in simulation studies to yield causal effect estimates with desirable properties. There are tools (e.g., the twang package in R) and guidance for implementing this method with two treatments. However, there is not such guidance for analyses of three or more treatments. The goals of this paper are twofold: (1) to provide step-by-step guidance for researchers who want to implement propensity score weighting for multiple treatments and (2) to propose the use of generalized boosted models (GBM) for estimation of the necessary propensity score weights. We define the causal quantities that may be of interest to studies of multiple treatments and derive weighted estimators of those quantities. We present a detailed plan for using GBM to estimate propensity scores and using those scores to estimate weights and causal effects. We also provide tools for assessing balance and overlap of pretreatment variables among treatment groups in the context of multiple treatments. A case study examining the effects of three treatment programs for adolescent substance abuse demonstrates the methods. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper illustrates the dynamics of SOC on the island of Java, Indonesia, from 1930 to 2010. We used 2002 soil profile observations containing organic carbon (C) analysis in the topsoil, which were collected by the Indonesian Center for Agricultural Land Resources Research \& Development from 1923 to 2007. Results show the obvious decline of SOC values from around 2\% in 1930–1940 to 0.8\% in 1960–1970. However, there has been an increase of SOC content since 1970, with a median level of 1.1\% in the year 2000. Our analysis suggests that the human influence and agricultural practices on SOC in Java have been a stronger influence than the environmental factors. SOC for the top 10 cm has shown a net accumulation rate of 0.2–0.3 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 during the period 1990–2000. These findings give rise to optimism for increased soil C sequestration in the tropics.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to predict and map SOC stocks at different depth intervals within the upper 1-m depth using profile depth distribution functions and ordinary kriging. These approaches were tested for the state of Indiana as a case study. A total of 464 pedons representing 204 soil series was obtained from the National Soil Survey Center database. Another 48 soil profile samples were collected to better represent the heterogeneity of the environmental variables. Two methods were used to model the depth distribution of the SOC stocks using negative exponential profile depth functions. In Procedure A, the functions to describe the depth distribution of volumetric C content for each soil profile were fitted using nonlinear least squares. In Procedure B, the exponential functions were fitted to describe the depth distribution of the cumulative SOC stocks. The parameters of the functions were interpolated for the entire study area using ordinary kriging on 81\% of the data points (n = 414). The integral of the exponential function up to the desired depth was used to predict SOC stocks within the 0- to 1-, 0- to 0.5-, and 0.5- to 1-m depth intervals. These estimates were validated using the remaining 19\% (n = 98) of the data. Procedure B showed a higher prediction accuracy for all depths, with higher r and lower RMSE values. The highest prediction accuracy (r = 0.75, RMSE = 2.89 kg m−2) was obtained for SOC stocks in the 0- to 0.5-m depth interval. Using Procedure B, SOC stocks within the top 1 m of Indiana soils were estimated to be 0.90 Pg C.},

  abstract = {Assessments of the global carbon (C) cycle typically rely on simplified models which consider large areas as homogeneous in terms of the response of soils to land use or consider very broad land classes. For example, “cropland” is typically modelled as an aggregation of distinct practices and individual crops over large regions. Here, we use the process-based Rothamsted soil Carbon Model (RothC model), which has a history of being successfully applied at a global scale, to calculate attainable SOC stocks and C mineralization rates for each of c. 17,000 regions (combination of soil type and texture, climate type, initial land use and country) in the World, under near-past climate conditions. We considered 28 individual crops and, for each, multiple production practices, plus 16 forest types and 1 grassland class (total of 80 classes). We find that conversion to cropland can result in SOC increases, particularly when the soil remains covered with crop residues (an average gain of 12 t C/ha) or using irrigation (4 t C/ha), which are mutually reinforcing effects. Attainable SOC stocks vary significantly depending on the land use class, particularly for cropland. Common aggregations in global modelling of a single agricultural class would be inaccurate representations of these results. Attainable SOC stocks obtained here were compared to long-term experiment data and are well aligned with the literature. Our results provide a regional and detailed understanding of C sequestration that will also enable better greenhouse gas reporting at national level as alternatives to IPCC tier 2 defaults.},

  abstract = {Texture is one of the main properties affecting the accuracy of visible (vis) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy during on-the-go measurement of soil properties. Classification of soil spectra into predefined texture classes is expected to increase the accuracy of measurement of other soil properties using separate groups of calibration models, each developed for one texture class. A mobile, fibre-type, vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Zeiss Corona 1.7 vis-NIR fibre), with a light reflectance measurement range of 306.5–1710.9 nm was used to measure the light reflectance from fresh soil samples collected from many fields in Belgium and northern France. A total of 365 soil samples were classified into four different texture classes, namely, coarse sandy, fine sandy, loamy and clayey soils. The factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) was applied on the first five principal components obtained from the principal component analysis performed on the vis-NIR spectra in order to classify soils into the four assigned groups. Correct classification (CC) of 85.7\% and 81.8\% was observed for the calibration and validation data sets, respectively. However, validation of the vis-NIR-FDA technique on the validation set showed poor discrimination between the coarse sandy and fine sandy soil groups, with a great deal of overlapping. Therefore, the soil groups were reduced to three groups by combining the coarse sandy and fine sandy soil groups into one group and FDA was applied again. A better classification was obtained with CC of 89.9 and 85.1\% for the calibration and validation data sets, respectively. However, the CC for the sand group in the validation set was rather small (46.7\%), which was attributed to the small sample number and poor correlation between sand fraction and vis-NIR spectroscopy. It was concluded that vis-NIR-FDA is an efficient technique to classify soil into three main groups of sandy (light soils), loamy (medium soils) and clayey (heavy soils). Additional samples from the sandy and clayey groups should be included to improve the accuracy of the vis-NIR-FDA classification models to be used for an on-the-go vis-NIR measurement system of soil properties.},

This paper provides analyses from 446 sites worldwide to evaluate the impact of environmental factors (MAP and MAT: mean annual precipitation and temperature; CLAY and BD: soil clay content and bulk density; S: slope gradient; LU: land use) on annual exports (RC: runoff coefficients; SL: sediment loads; TOCL: organic carbon losses; TNL: nitrogen losses; TPL: phosphorus losses) from different spatial scales. RC was found to increase, on average, from 18\% at local scale (in headwaters), 25\% at microcatchment and subcatchment scale (midreaches) to 41\% at catchment scale (lower reaches of river basins) in response to multiple factors. SL increased from microplots (468 g m−2 yr−1) to plots (901 g m−2 yr−1), accompanied by decreasing TOCL and TNL. Climate was a major control masking the effects of other factors. For example, RC, SL, TOCL, TNL, and TPL tended to increase with MAP at all spatial scales. These variables, however, decreased with MAT. The impact of CLAY, BD, LU, and S on erosion variables was largely confined to the hillslope scale, where RC, SL, and TOCL decreased with CLAY, while TNL and TPL increased. The results contribute to better understanding of water, nutrient, and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems and should inform river basin modeling and ecosystem management. The important role of spatial climate variability points to a need for comparative research in specific environments at nested spatiotemporal scales.},

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important reservoir for atmospheric CO2 associated with climate warming. The High Plains, USA, lacks region-wide SOC estimates within playa wetlands and their adjacent watershed. Croplands often have less SOC than grasslands, and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP; former croplands planted to grass) may return SOC. Our goals were to estimate SOC within playa wetlands and investigate small scale differences within wetland catchments across a broad agriculturally modified landscape. We estimated SOC (kgm−2) to 50cm depth from 4 soil cores/catchment (in playas and 10, 40 and 100m into uplands) at 56, 52, and 54 sites in native grassland, CRP and cropland, respectively. At a subset of sample locations within each land use type, we estimated SOC to 1m depth to characterize SOC missed by shallow sampling. In playa wetlands, CRP SOC from 0 to 50cm was 18\% greater than croplands, but native grassland playa SOC did not differ from other land-uses. From 0 to 1m, SOC in native grassland wetlands and uplands was 20\% greater than the same habitats within croplands, while CRP lands were intermediate. Native grassland playa SOC also was 16\% greater than in surrounding native short grass prairie. Playas therefore represent an important SOC repository in the High Plains ecoregion. CRP playas and uplands may require an additional 10–30 years to resemble native grassland SOC. SOC increased with playa area throughout CRP and native grassland catchments, suggesting playa hydrogeomorphology influences adjacent upland SOC. High Plains playas store 20.8Tg C and cropland conversion caused a cumulative loss of 2.0Tg C from 82,000ha of playas. Currently, CRP enrollment on over 25,000ha of playas has returned 0.2Tg C (95\% CI: 0.1–0.3), only half the historic SOC lost by cropland conversion within CRP playas. To promote SOC storage, native grasslands and large playas should be preserved and CRP enrollments should be maintained over long timescales.},

Benefits may not be realized immediately in semiarid conditions though, and longer-term effects of legumes and intensified cropping in this region are unclear, particularly in no-till systems. We compared effects of four no-till wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systems–summer fallow–wheat (F–W), continuous wheat (CW), legume green manure (pea, Pisum sativum L.)—wheat (LGM–W), and pea–wheat (P–W)—on select soil attributes in an 8-year-old rotation study, and N fertilizer effects on C and N mineralization on a duplicate soil set in a laboratory experiment. We analyzed potentially mineralizable carbon and nitrogen (PMC and PMN) and mineralization trends with a nonlinear model, microbial biomass carbon (MB-C), and wet aggregate stability (WAS). Legume-containing systems generally resulted in higher PMC, PMN, and MB-C, while intensified systems (CW and P–W) had higher WAS. Half-lives of PMC were shortest in intensified systems, and were longest in legume systems (LGM–W and P–W) for PMN. Nitrogen addition depressed C and N mineralization, particularly in CW, and generally shortened the half-life of mineralizable C. Legumes may increase long-term, no-till NGP agroecosystem resilience and sustainability by (1) increasing the available N-supply (\textasciitilde 26–50~\%) compared to wheat-only systems, thereby reducing the need for N fertilizer for subsequent crops, and (2) by potentially mitigating negative effects of SOM loss from summer fallow.},

  abstract = {Process-based model analyses are often used to estimate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), particularly at regional to continental scales. However, uncertainties are rarely evaluated, and so it is difficult to determine how much confidence can be placed in the results. Our objective was to quantify uncertainties across multiple scales in a process-based model analysis, and provide 95\% confidence intervals for the estimates. Specifically, we used the Century ecosystem model to estimate changes in SOC stocks for US croplands during the 1990s, addressing uncertainties in model inputs, structure and scaling of results from point locations to regions and the entire country. Overall, SOC stocks increased in US croplands by 14.6 Tg C yr−1 from 1990 to 1995 and 17.5 Tg C yr−1 during 1995 to 2000, and uncertainties were ±22\% and ±16\% for the two time periods, respectively. Uncertainties were inversely related to spatial scale, with median uncertainties at the regional scale estimated at ±118\% and ±114\% during the early and latter part of 1990s, and even higher at the site scale with estimates at ±739\% and ±674\% for the time periods, respectively.

  abstract = {Process-based model analyses are often used to estimate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), particularly at regional to continental scales. However, uncertainties are rarely evaluated, and so it is difficult to determine how much confidence can be placed in the results. Our objective was to quantify uncertainties across multiple scales in a process-based model analysis, and provide 95\% confidence intervals for the estimates. Specifically, we used the Century ecosystem model to estimate changes in SOC stocks for US croplands during the 1990s, addressing uncertainties in model inputs, structure and scaling of results from point locations to regions and the entire country. Overall, SOC stocks increased in US croplands by 14.6 Tg C yr−1 from 1990 to 1995 and 17.5 Tg C yr−1 during 1995 to 2000, and uncertainties were ±22\% and ±16\% for the two time periods, respectively. Uncertainties were inversely related to spatial scale, with median uncertainties at the regional scale estimated at ±118\% and ±114\% during the early and latter part of 1990s, and even higher at the site scale with estimates at ±739\% and ±674\% for the time periods, respectively. This relationship appeared to be driven by the amount of the SOC stock change; changes in stocks that exceeded 200 Gg C yr−1 represented a threshold where uncertainties were always lower than ±100\%. Consequently, the amount of uncertainty in estimates derived from process-based models will partly depend on the level of SOC accumulation or loss.

  abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is an indicator of environmental quality for mineral soils because of the influence that organic matter has on key functional properties, such as fertility, soil structure and water relations. Historically, agricultural management has caused large losses of SOC relative to native ecosystems, leading to degradation. However, new technologies and conservation practices have been developed during the past few decades that can enhance SOC storage, and thus improve environmental quality. Our objective was to describe a national inventory procedure to estimate SOC storage for purposes of monitoring environmental quality. The major steps in this procedure include: (1) model selection/development, (2) model verification, (3) identification of model input data, (4) uncertainty assessment, (5) model implementation, and (6) validation of results. Applying this approach With a simple C accounting method, the upper 30 cm of US agricultural soils were estimated to have accumulated 10.8 Tg C yr(-1) between 1982 and 1997, with an uncertainty of +/- 40\%. A simple index was developed to relate estimated SOC stocks to the potential amounts under native conditions and conventional agricultural management. An index value of 0\% on the proposed scale would be equivalent to the SOC under conventional agricultural use, while an index value of 100\% would be equivalent to native levels. With an estimated 1997 stock of 22400 Tg C, the index value for US agricultural soils was about 60\%. Using this inventory procedure, environmental issues related to soil, water and air quality could be informed by SOC in combination with other key indicators, in addition to using the inventory for evaluating sustainability of agricultural lands for food and fiber production.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty was quantified for an inventory estimating change in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage resulting from modifications in land use and management across US agricultural lands between 1982 and 1997. This inventory was conducted using a modified version of a carbon (C) accounting method developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Probability density functions (PDFs) were derived for each input to the IPCC model, including reference SOC stocks, land use/management activity data, and management factors. Change in C storage was estimated using a Monte-Carlo approach with 50 000 iterations, by randomly selecting values from the PDFs after accounting for dependencies in the model inputs. Over the inventory period, mineral soils had a net gain of 10.8 Tg C yr−1, with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from 6.5 to 15.3 Tg C yr−1. Most of this gain was due to setting-aside lands in the Conservation Reserve Program. In contrast, managed organic soils lost 9.4 Tg C yr−1, with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from 6.4 to 13.3 Tg C yr−1. Combining these gains and losses in SOC, US agricultural soils accrued 1.3 Tg C yr−1 due to land use and management change, with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from a loss of 4.4 Tg C yr−1 to a gain of 6.9 Tg C yr−1. Most of the uncertainty was attributed to management factors for tillage, land use change between cultivated and uncultivated conditions, and C loss rates from managed organic soils. Based on the uncertainty, we are not able to conclude with 95\% confidence that change in US agricultural land use and management between 1982 and 1997 created a net C sink for atmospheric CO2.},

Yet to date, the full potential of natural systems to store carbon has not been leveraged because policymakers have required long-term contracts to compensate for permanence concerns, and these long-term contracts substantially raise costs and limit deployment. In this paper, we lay out the rationale that our time preference for early action leads to the conclusion that multiple tons of short-term storage of carbon in ecosystem stocks can be considered to have equal value – as measured by the social cost of carbon – as 1 ton of carbon sequestered permanently. This equivalence can be used to quantify the value of short-term carbon storage, thereby removing one of the most significant barriers to participation in the carbon market and enabling the full climate mitigation potential of the land sector to be realized.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon (C) sequestration is one of three main approaches to carbon dioxide removal and storage through management of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil C sequestration relies of the adoption of improved management practices that increase the amount of carbon stored as soil organic matter, primarily in cropland and grazing lands. These C sequestering practices act by increasing the rate of input of plant-derived residues to soils and/or by reducing the rates of turnover of organic C stocks already in the soil. In addition to carbon dioxide removal potential, increases in soil organic matter/soil C content are highly beneficial from the standpoint of soil health and soil fertility. Practices to increase soil C stocks include well-known, proven techniques, or “best management practices” (BMP) for building soil carbon. A second category includes what we refer to as frontier technologies for which significant technological and/or economic barriers exist today, but for which further R\&D and/or economic incentives might offer the potential for greater sequestration over the longer term. We reviewed published estimates of global soil carbon sequestration potential, representing the biophysical potential for managed cropland and/or grassland systems to store additional carbon assuming widespread (near complete) adoption of BMPs. The majority of studies suggests that 4–5 GtCO2/y as an upper limit for global biophysical potential with near complete adoption of BMPs. In the longer-term, if frontier technologies are successfully deployed, the global estimate might grow to 8 GtCO2/y. There is a strong scientific basis for managing agricultural soils to act as a significant carbon (C) sink over the next several decades. A two-stage strategy, to first incentivize adoption of well-developed, conventional soil C sequestering practices, while investing in R\&D on new frontier technologies that could come on-line in the next 2–3 decades, could maximize benefits. Implementation of such policies will require robust, scientifically-sound measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems to track that policy goals are being met and that claimed increases in soil C stocks are real.},

  abstract = {Climate models indicate that increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could alter climate globally. The EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) model was used to examine the sensitivity of corn and soybean yields over the US corn belt to changes in temperature, precipitation, wind, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. A statistically representative sample of 100 corn and soybean production sites was selected from the 1987 National Resources Inventory (NRI). One-hundred-year simulations were run for each site under 36 different climate/CO2 scenarios. The results were area weighted according to the NRI area expansion factors to produce a regionally aggregated estimate of yields. EPIC did an excellent job of reproducing current regional mean expected yields under the baseline scenario. There were 3\% decreases in both corn and soybean yields in response to a 2°C temperature increase at baseline precipitation levels, with larger and smaller temperature effects under drier and wetter conditions, respectively. Crop yields increased and decreased in response to increases and decreases of 10\% or 20\% precipitation. A 10\% precipitation increase roughly balanced the negative effect of the 2°C temperature increase. Whether the precipitation changes resulted from altered precipitation event frequency or amount per event had little effect on mean crop yields; however interannual yield variability was higher when precipitation decreases were due to frequency rather than intensity. The opposite was true, though to a lesser extent, for precipitation increases. Potential evapotranspiration responded linearly to changes in mean wind speed, leading to modest changes of 1–3 days of water stress per growing season, yield increases of up to 2\% for decreased wind, and yield decreases of up to 6\% for increased wind. Elevated CO2 concentrations of 625 ppmv gave the greatest yield increases, + 17\% for corn and + 27\% for soybean at baseline temperature and precipitation levels. The relative CO2 effect was larger under drier conditions.},

  abstract = {A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields, like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated with SOC stock change (R2=0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32±0.08Mgha−1yr−1 in a mean soil depth of 22cm and during the observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock accumulation of 16.7±1.5Mgha−1 for a soil depth of 22cm. Thus, the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC sequestration of 0.12±0.03PgCyr−1, which would compensate for 8\% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable greenhouse gas budgets.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen fertilization is critical to optimize short-term crop yield, but its long-term effect on soil organic C (SOC) is uncertain. Here, we clarify the impact of N fertilization on SOC in typical maize-based (Zea mays L.) Midwest U.S. cropping systems by accounting for site-to-site variability in maize yield response to N fertilization. Within continuous maize and maize-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems at four Iowa locations, we evaluated changes in surface SOC over 14 to 16 years across a range of N fertilizer rates empirically determined to be insufficient, optimum, or excessive for maximum maize yield. Soil organic C balances were negative where no N was applied but neutral (maize-soybean) or positive (continuous maize) at the agronomic optimum N rate (AONR). For continuous maize, the rate of SOC storage increased with increasing N rate, reaching a maximum at the AONR and decreasing above the AONR. Greater SOC storage in the optimally fertilized continuous maize system than in the optimally fertilized maize-soybean system was attributed to greater crop residue production and greater SOC storage efficiency in the continuous maize system. Mean annual crop residue production at the AONR was 22\% greater in the continuous maize system than in the maize-soybean system and the rate of SOC storage per unit residue C input was 58\% greater in the monocrop system. Our results demonstrate that agronomic optimum N fertilization is critical to maintain or increase SOC of Midwest U.S. cropland.},

The study began in 1981 at Lamberton, MN, on a Webster clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquoll), in 1982 at Waseca, MN, on a Nicollet clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Hapludoll), and in 1983 at Arlington, WI, on a Plano silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiudoll). Cropping sequences were (i) continuous monoculture of each crop; (ii) annual rotation of the two crops; and (iii) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 yr of each crop following 5 yr of the other crop. Results are based on 11 yr of data at Lamberton, 8 yr (soybean) or 9 yr (corn) at Waseca, and 9 yr at Arlington. Corn rotated annually with soybean yielded 13\% more, and 1st-yr corn following multiple years of soybean yielded 15\% more than continuous corn. Soybean annually rotated with corn yielded 10\% more, and 1st-yr soybean following multiple years of corn yielded 18\% more than continuous soybean. The crops differed in response to increasing years of consecutive planting: 2nd-yr to 5th-yr corn yields were no different from continuous corn yields; 2nd-yr soybean yielded 8\% more than continuous soybean, 3rd-yr soybean yielded 3\% more, and 4th- and 5th-yr soybean yielded the same as continuous soybean. Relative increase in yields of both crops in annual rotation compared with monoculture was approximately twofold greater in low-yielding than in high-yielding environments. In low-yielding environments, the yield advantage of an annual rotation of corn and soybean compared with monoculture was frequently greater than 25\%. The commonly practiced annual rotation of corn and soybean maximized corn yields, but not soybean yields, relative to the other sequences studied.},

  abstract = {When agricultural land is no longer used for cultivation and allowed to revert to natural vegetation or replanted to perennial vegetation, soil organic carbon can accumulate. This accumulation process essentially reverses some of the effects responsible for soil organic carbon losses from when the land was converted from perennial vegetation. We discuss the essential elements of what is known about soil organic matter dynamics that may result in enhanced soil carbon sequestration with changes in land-use and soil management. We review literature that reports changes in soil organic carbon after changes in land-use that favour carbon accumulation. This data summary provides a guide to approximate rates of SOC sequestration that are possible with management, and indicates the relative importance of some factors that influence the rates of organic carbon sequestration in soil. There is a large variation in the length of time for and the rate at which carbon may accumulate in soil, related to the productivity of the recovering vegetation, physical and biological conditions in the soil, and the past history of soil organic carbon inputs and physical disturbance. Maximum rates of C accumulation during the early aggrading stage of perennial vegetation growth, while substantial, are usually much less than 100 g C m−2 y−1. Average rates of accumulation are similar for forest or grassland establishment: 33.8 g C m−2 y−1 and 33.2 g C m−2 y−1, respectively. These observed rates of soil organic C accumulation, when combined with the small amount of land area involved, are insufficient to account for a significant fraction of the missing C in the global carbon cycle as accumulating in the soils of formerly agricultural land.},

  abstract = {Use of a single factor for converting soil organic carbon to soil organic matter is challenged. The basis for this challenge arises from four sources: the original papers published in the nineteenth century, empirical studies published throughout the twentieth century, theoretical considerations of organic matter composition, and a consideration of what led to the popularity and general acceptance of the conventional factor. The conventional factor of 1.724, based on the assumption that soil organic matter contains 58\% carbon, applies only to some soils or only to particular components of soil organic matter. Studies published since the end of the nineteenth century have consistently shown that the factor of 1.724 is too low for most soils. In a review of previously published data, the median value for the conversion factor was found to be 1.9 from empirical studies and 2 from more theoretical considerations. A factor of 2, based on the assumption that organic matter is 50\% carbon, would in almost all cases be more accurate than the conventional factor of 1.724. A consideration of the possible variation in organic matter composition predicts a range of factor values between 1.4 and 2.5, a range that is narrower than empirical results at least in part because of the interaction between the methods used to estimate organic matter and soil composition. Convenience, authority, and tradition rather than strength of evidence are in large part responsible for the widespread acceptance of the conventional factor.},

  abstract = {Cover crops have been reported as one of the most effective practices to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) for agroecosystems. Impacts of cover crops on SOC change vary depending on soil properties, climate, and management practices, but it remains unclear how these control factors affect SOC benefits from cover crops, as well as which management practices can maximize SOC benefits. To address these questions, we used an advanced process-based agroecosystem model, ecosys, to assess the impacts of winter cover cropping on SOC accumulation under different environmental and management conditions. We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent do cover crops benefit SOC accumulation, and how do SOC benefits from cover crops vary with different factors (i.e., initial soil properties, cover crop types, climate during the cover crop growth period, and cover crop planting and terminating time)? (2) How can we enhance SOC benefits from cover crops under different cover crop management options? Specifically, we first calibrated and validated the ecosys model at two long-term field experiment sites with SOC measurements in Illinois. We then applied the ecosys model to six cover crop field experiment sites spanning across Illinois to assess the impacts of different factors on SOC accumulation. Our modeling results revealed the following findings: (1) Growing cover crops can bring SOC benefits by 0.33 ± 0.06 MgC ha−1 year−1 in six cover crop field experiment sites across Illinois, and the SOC benefits are species specific to legume and non-legume cover crops. (2) Initial SOC stocks and clay contents had overall small influences on SOC benefits from cover crops. During the cover crop growth period (i.e., winter and spring in the US Midwest), high temperature increased SOC benefits from cover crops, while the impacts from larger precipitation on SOC benefits varied field by field. (3) The SOC benefits from cover crops can be maximized by optimizing cover crop management practices (e.g., selecting cover crop types and controlling cover crop growth period) for the US Midwestern maize–soybean rotation system. Finally, we discussed the economic and policy implications of adopting cover crops in the US Midwest, including that current economic incentives to grow cover crops may not be sufficient to cover costs. This study systematically assessed cover crop impacts for SOC change in the US Midwest context, while also demonstrating that the ecosys model, with rigorous validation using field experiment data, can be an effective tool to guide the adaptive management of cover crops and quantify SOC benefits from cover crops. The study thus provides practical tools and insights for practitioners and policy-makers to design cover crop related government agricultural policies and incentive programs for farmers and agri-food related industries.},

  abstract = {The Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) project was conducted by the US Department of Agriculture’s National Resources Conservation Service between 2010–2012 in order to provide contemporaneous measurements of soil organic carbon (SOC) across the US. Despite the broad extent of the RaCA data collection effort, direct observations of SOC are not available at the high spatial resolution needed for studying carbon storage in soil and its implications for important problems in climate science and agriculture. As a result, there is a need for predicting SOC at spatial locations not included as part of the RaCA project. In this paper, we compare spatial prediction of SOC using a subset of the RaCA data for a variety of statistical methods. We investigate the performance of methods with off-the-shelf software available (both stationary and nonstationary) as well as a novel nonstationary approach based on partitioning relevant spatially-varying covariate processes. Our new method addresses open questions regarding (1) how to partition the spatial domain for segmentation-based nonstationary methods, (2) incorporating partially observed covariates into a spatial model, and (3) accounting for uncertainty in the partitioning. In applying the various statistical methods we find that there are minimal differences in out-of-sample criteria for this particular data set, however, there are major differences in maps of uncertainty in SOC predictions. We argue that the spatially-varying measures of prediction uncertainty produced by our new approach are valuable to decision makers, as they can be used to better benchmark mechanistic models, identify target areas for soil restoration projects, and inform carbon sequestration projects.},

  abstract = {Meeting end-of-century global warming targets requires aggressive action on multiple fronts. Recent reports note the futility of addressing mitigation goals without fully engaging the agricultural sector, yet no available assessments combine both nature-based solutions (reforestation, grassland and wetland protection, and agricultural practice change) and cellulosic bioenergy for a single geographic region. Collectively, these solutions might offer a suite of climate, biodiversity, and other benefits greater than either alone. Nature-based solutions are largely constrained by the duration of carbon accrual in soils and forest biomass; each of these carbon pools will eventually saturate. Bioenergy solutions can last indefinitely but carry significant environmental risk if carelessly deployed. We detail a simplified scenario for the United States that illustrates the benefits of combining approaches. We assign a portion of non-forested former cropland to bioenergy sufficient to meet projected mid-century transportation needs, with the remainder assigned to nature-based solutions such as reforestation. Bottom-up mitigation potentials for the aggregate contributions of crop, grazing, forest, and bioenergy lands are assessed by including in a Monte Carlo model conservative ranges for cost-effective local mitigation capacities, together with ranges for (a) areal extents that avoid double counting and include realistic adoption rates and (b) the projected duration of different carbon sinks. The projected duration illustrates the net effect of eventually saturating soil carbon pools in the case of most strategies, and additionally saturating biomass carbon pools in the case of forest management. Results show a conservative end-of-century mitigation capacity of 110 (57–178) Gt CO2e for the U.S., 50\% higher than existing estimates that prioritize nature-based or bioenergy solutions separately. Further research is needed to shrink uncertainties, but there is sufficient confidence in the general magnitude and direction of a combined approach to plan for deployment now.},

  abstract = {Land-based climate mitigation measures have gained significant attention and importance in public and private sector climate policies. Building on previous studies, we refine and update the mitigation potentials for 20 land-based measures in {$>$}200 countries and five regions, comparing “bottom-up” sectoral estimates with integrated assessment models (IAMs). We also assess implementation feasibility at the country level. Cost-effective (available up to \$100/tCO2eq) land-based mitigation is 8–13.8 GtCO2eq yr−1 between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the IAM median and the upper end representing the sectoral estimate. The cost-effective sectoral estimate is about 40\% of available technical potential and is in line with achieving a 1.5°C pathway in 2050. Compared to technical potentials, cost-effective estimates represent a more realistic and actionable target for policy. The cost-effective potential is approximately 50\% from forests and other ecosystems, 35\% from agriculture, and 15\% from demand-side measures. The potential varies sixfold across the five regions assessed (0.75–4.8 GtCO2eq yr−1) and the top 15 countries account for about 60\% of the global potential. Protection of forests and other ecosystems and demand-side measures present particularly high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs. The feasibility assessment suggests that governance, economic investment, and socio-cultural conditions influence the likelihood that land-based mitigation potentials are realized. A substantial portion of potential (80\%) is in developing countries and LDCs, where feasibility barriers are of greatest concern. Assisting countries to overcome barriers may result in significant quantities of near-term, low-cost mitigation while locally achieving important climate adaptation and development benefits. Opportunities among countries vary widely depending on types of land-based measures available, their potential co-benefits and risks, and their feasibility. Enhanced investments and country-specific plans that accommodate this complexity are urgently needed to realize the large global potential from improved land stewardship.},

We analyzed the impact on SOC of four N fertilization rates (0–270 kg N ha−1) and four cropping systems: continuous corn (CC) (Zea mays L.); corn–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (CS); corn–corn–oat–alfalfa (oat, Avena sativa L.; alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.) (CCOA), and corn–oat–alfalfa–alfalfa (COAA). Soils were sampled in 2002, Years 23 and 48 of the experiments located in northeast and north-central Iowa, respectively. The experiments were conducted using a replicated split-plot design under conventional tillage. A native prairie was sampled to provide a reference (for one site only). Cropping systems that contained alfalfa had the highest SOC stocks, whereas the CS system generally had the lowest SOC stocks. Concentrations of SOC increased significantly between 1990 and 2002 in only two of the nine systems for which historical data were available, the fertilized CC and COAA systems at one site. Soil quality indices such as particulate organic carbon (POC) were influenced by cropping system, with CS {$<$} CC {$<$} CCOA. In the native prairie, SOC, POC, and resistant C concentrations were 2.8, 2.6, and 3.9 times, respectively, the highest values in cropped soil, indicating that cultivated soils had not recovered to precultivation conditions. Although corn yields increased with N additions, N fertilization increased SOC stocks only in the CC system at one site. Considering the C cost for N fertilizer production, N fertilization generally had a net negative effect on C sequestration.},

Simultaneously, renewable energy options become more attractive to agricultural producers. We consider both of these impacts, estimating the economic and environmental consequences of higher energy prices on U.S. agriculture. To do this we employ a price-endogenous agricultural sector model and solve that model for a range of carbon-tax-based energy price changes. Our results show mostly positive impacts on net farm income in the intermediate run. Through market price adjustments, fossil fuel costs are largely passed on to consumers. Additional farm revenue arises from the production of biofuels when carbon taxes reach \$30 per ton of carbon or more. Positive environmental benefits include not only greenhouse gas emission offsets but also reduced levels of nitrogen leaching.},

  abstract = {Forests can play a large role in climate change through the sequestration or emission of carbon, an important greenhouse gas; through biological growth, which can increase forest stocks; or through deforestation, which can increase carbon emissions. Carbon is captured not only in tree biomass but also in forest soils. Forest management and public policy can strongly influence the sequestration process. Economic policies can provide incentives for both forest expansion and contraction. Systems that provide prices for carbon sequestration or taxes for emissions can have important effects on emission and sequestration levels. Issues involve carbon additionality, permanence, and leakage. Forest measurement, monitoring, and verification also provide serious challenges. Various economic models are used to estimate the effects of various economic policies on forest carbon stocks. Estimates from the literature of some actual and potential levels of forest carbon are presented.},

  abstract = {This study develops cumulative carbon ''supply curves'' for global forests utilizing a dynamic timber supply model for sequestration of forest carbon. Because the period of concern is the next century, and particular time points within that century, the curves are not traditional Marshallian supply curves or steady-state supply curves. Rather, the focus is on cumulative carbon cost curves (quasi-supply curves) at various points in time over the next 100 years. The research estimates a number of long-term, cumulative, carbon quasi-supply curves under different price scenarios and for different time periods. The curves trace out the relationship between an intertemporal price path for carbon, as given by carbon shadow prices, and the cumulative carbon sequestered from the initiation of the shadow prices, set at 2000, to a selected future year (2010, 2050, 2100). The timber supply model demonstrates that cumulative carbon quasi-supply curves that can be generated through forestry significantly depend on initial carbon prices and expectations regarding the time profile of future carbon prices. Furthermore, long-run quasi-supply curves generated from a constant price will have somewhat different characteristics from quasi-supply curves generated with an expectation of rising carbon prices through time.The ?least-cost? curves vary the time periods under consideration and the time profile of carbon prices. The quasi-supply curves suggest that a policy of gradually increasing carbon prices will generate the least costly supply curves in the shorter periods of a decade or so. Over longer periods of time, however, such as 50 or 100 years, these advantages appear to dissipate.},

  abstract = {Soil bulk density (ρb) is important because of its direct effect on soil properties (e.g., porosity, soil moisture availability) and crop yield. Additionally, ρb measurements are needed to express soil organic carbon (SOC) and other nutrient stocks on an area basis (kgha−1). However, ρb measurements are commonly missing from databases for reasons that include omission due to sampling constraints and laboratory mishandling. The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of novel pedotransfer functions (PTFs) in predicting ρb as a function of textural class and basic pedon description information extracted from the horizon of interest (the horizon for which ρb is being predicted), and ρb, textural class, and basic pedon description information extracted from horizons above or below and directly adjacent or not adjacent to the horizon of interest. A total of 2,680 pedons (20,045 horizons) were gathered from the USDA-NRCS National Soil Survey Center characterization database. Twelve ρb PTFs were developed by combining PTF types, database configurations, and horizon limiting depths. Different PTF types were created considering the direction of prediction in the soil profile: upward and downward prediction models. Multiple database configurations were used to mimic different scenarios of horizons missing ρb values: random missing (e.g., ρb sample lost in transit) and patterned or systematic missing (e.g., no ρb samples collected for horizons{$>$}30cm depth). For each database configuration scenario, upward and downward models were developed separately. Three limiting depths (20, 30, and 50cm) were tested to identify any threshold depth between upward and downward models. For both PTF types, validation results indicated that models derived from the database configuration mimicking random horizons missing ρb performed better than those derived from the configuration mimicking clear patterns of missing ρb measurements. All 12 PTFs performed well (RMSPE: 0.10–0.15gcm−3). The threshold depth of 50cm most successfully split the database between upward and downward models. For all PTFs, the ρb of other horizons in the soil profile was the most important variable in predicting ρb. The proposed PTFs provide reasonably accurate ρb predictions, and have the potential to help researchers and other users to fill gaps in their database without complicated data acquisition.},

  abstract = {Core Ideas SOC stocks are highly variable at the agroecosystem scale. Optimized sampling and estimation approaches are crucial for low cost SOC assessment. Systematic sampling provided thorough geographic and attribute space coverage. Ordinary kriging outperformed regression kriging, simple mean, and SSURGO approaches. Low-cost approaches for measuring soil organic C (SOC) stocks are essential for verifying farm management effects on C sequestration in agroecosystems. This study compared sampling and data analysis optimization approaches for estimating SOC stocks of a complex agroecosystem. Soil samples were collected from a 232-ha area of a working dairy farm with multiple land uses, crop rotations, topographic features, and manure application rates. The SOC stocks were estimated by (i) simple mean, (ii) ordinary kriging, (iii) regression kriging, and (iv) using the USDA Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. Relationships among sampling schemes, estimation approaches, auxiliary information, and SOC stocks were explored. Slope, elevation, soil type, and land use types displayed a high degree of variation at the study site, yet relationships with SOC stocks were weak or nonsignificant. Systematic sampling provided the best coverage of both geographic and attribute space, allowing reliable variogram estimates and RMSEs that increased little with reduced sample number. Random and stratified random sampling approaches resulted in reduced accuracy. Ordinary kriging had lower RMSEs than either regression kriging or the simple mean, and total SOC stocks estimates fluctuated less when sample sizes were reduced. Using SSURGO overestimated total SOC stocks by up to 5.1\% compared with the other approaches, suggesting that this approach may be worthy of evaluation for circumstances with a low budget and low confidence level requirements. Systematic sampling and ordinary kriging can provide an optimal strategy for estimating SOC stocks in agroecosystems with complex topography and land uses.},

  abstract = {Agricultural land devoted to vegetable crops in the Caribbean has strongly increased during the past twenty years, which raises major concerns regarding a reduction in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks because of low C inputs and high SOC outputs from these cropping systems. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of farming practices on SOC stocks at the farm type level. We designed a framework which encompasses a farm typology describing the diversity of farm practices applied to vegetable crops and a model of SOC dynamics to estimate the impact of these practices on SOC stocks. The study was carried out in the Guadeloupe archipelago, which offers a good representation of the variability of Caribbean agriculture, in a context of transition from traditional sugarcane and banana monocultures for export to a more diversified agriculture including vegetable crops. A farm typology was developed from a survey of 71 farmers concerning their socio-economic characteristics and farming practices. The MorGwanik model of SOC dynamics was then used to assess the impact of farming practices on SOC at the farm type level, and to interpret the observed SOC changes. Five farm types were identified varying from traditional export agriculture with low diversification to monoculture of vegetable crops based on compost application and reduced soil tillage. The observed and simulated results indicated that systems with a fallow/vegetables cycle ratio{$>$}2 and the monoculture of vegetables including compost applications at ≥10Mgha−1yr−1 presented C sequestration corresponding to SOC increases of 10\% and 3\% of the initial stock, respectively. The monoculture of vegetables with a compost rate{$<$}10Mgha−1yr−1 and systems including vegetables in rotation with export crops and a short fallow cycle presented a reduction in SOC that ranged from 10\% to 18\%. Pedoclimatic conditions had a lower impact on SOC changes. Similar socio-economic profiles of farmers were observed for farm types including very different cropping systems. The model well described SOC changes for each farm type and offered valuable insights about the factors affecting SOC losses and C sequestration. The framework proposed in this study was helpful to identify improved managements that can maintain or increase SOC stocks under tropical conditions.},

Most recent scenarios from integrated assessment models require large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies (NETs) to reach the 2 °C target. A recent analysis of NETs, including direct air capture, enhanced weathering, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation/deforestation, showed that all NETs have significant limits to implementation, including economic cost, energy requirements, land use, and water use. In this paper, I assess the potential for negative emissions from soil carbon sequestration and biochar addition to land, and also the potential global impacts on land use, water, nutrients, albedo, energy and cost. Results indicate that soil carbon sequestration and biochar have useful negative emission potential (each 0.7 GtCeq. yr−1) and that they potentially have lower impact on land, water use, nutrients, albedo, energy requirement and cost, so have fewer disadvantages than many NETs. Limitations of soil carbon sequestration as a NET centre around issues of sink saturation and reversibility. Biochar could be implemented in combination with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Current integrated assessment models do not represent soil carbon sequestration or biochar. Given the negative emission potential of SCS and biochar and their potential advantages compared to other NETs, efforts should be made to include these options within IAMs, so that their potential can be explored further in comparison with other NETs for climate stabilization.},

A number of excellent studies have explored how carbon sequestration in aboveground components would affect a number of these decisions (Parks and Hardie, 1995; Van Kooten et al., 1995; Plantinga et al., 1999; Stavins, 1999).

  abstract = {When assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and its climate change (CC) mitigation potential at global scale, the dynamic nature of soil carbon storage and interventions to foster it should be taken into account. Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then SOC will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new SOC equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential SOC sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding CC mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87-year (2014–2100) global SOC sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1.9–3.9\% of the SRES-A2 projected 87-year anthropogenic emissions. SOC sequestration would peak 2032–33, at that time reaching 4.3–8.9\% of the projected annual SRES-A2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, SOC sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing SOC for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global significance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC.},

According to the calculated mean normalized difference tillage index data (NDTI), in the period 2003 to 2014, area of conservation tillage fields increased at a rate of 8.41 \%, while no-tillage fields decreased at a rate of 14.45 \%. Comparing normalized difference index (NDI) data from 2003 and in 2014 it was determined that a reduction of 10\% vegetated areas occurred. Normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NSDVI) values did not evidence significant change over a nearly 10 year period. The best determination of tillage practices was obtained using the cellulose absorption index (CAI) value calculated from Hyperspectral data.

Because the global validation database should expand over time as new validation data are contributed, the sampling design must be constructed so that it is simple to increase the sample size from a specific region (e.g. a continent or country) or from targeted land-cover classes to improve standard errors of the accuracy estimates. Stratified random sampling provides the desired adaptability to augment a sample to address regional or class-specific accuracy objectives. The proposed global validation database will be initiated from a baseline global stratified sample and then this baseline sample will be augmented to address accuracy objectives related to a specific map or region. The strata are constructed from a modified Köppen climate classification and population density. The theory and formulas for estimating accuracy from the combined baseline and augmented stratified samples are presented, and an example application is provided in which the regional accuracy of a land-cover map is assessed. The stratification used for the baseline global sample is retained when the augmented sample is subsequently selected. Alternatively, it is possible to ‘restratify’ the design so that the land-cover classes of a particular map are used as strata when selecting an augmented sample. The protocol for restratifying the design is presented, but the complexity of this option makes it less practical than retaining the initial strata when selecting an augmented sample.},

Small changes in the soil organic carbon stock could result in significant impacts on the atmospheric carbon concentration. The fluxes of soil organic carbon vary in response to a host of potential environmental and anthropogenic driving factors. Scientists worldwide are contemplating questions such as: ‘What is the average net change in soil organic carbon due to environmental conditions or management practices?’, ‘How can soil organic carbon sequestration be enhanced to achieve some mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide?’ and ‘Will this secure soil quality?’. These questions are far reaching, because maintaining and improving the world's soil resource is imperative to providing sufficient food and fibre to a growing population. Additional challenges are expected through climate change and its potential to increase food shortages. This review highlights knowledge of the amount of carbon stored in soils globally, and the potential for carbon sequestration in soil. It also discusses successful methods and models used to determine and estimate carbon pools and fluxes. This knowledge and technology underpins decisions to protect the soil resource.},

  abstract = {Data mining from existing County soil surveys can improve the utility of maps for research, management and decision making. Aggregated soil series information in soil survey map units can be disaggregated by following a possibilistic decision tree approach to provide maps at the soil series level. The “overall map unit composition percentage” available in the soil survey tabular data can be treated as a possibility distribution of the prevalence of different soil series within all occurrences of the map unit in the survey area. A case study was conducted in Monroe County in southeastern Ohio. Three different learning approaches including C4.5 decision trees, nonspecificity based possibilistic decision trees and clustering based possibilistic decision trees were applied to the existent County survey, and the efficiency of predicting soils at the series level was assessed using an independent soil series point data set. The results showed an improvement in prediction accuracy by following the clustered possibilistic decision tree approach. The maps were useful in identifying the locations of component soil series within map unit associations, consociations, and complexes. Data mining from existent soil survey maps using the component information available in the tabular data can serve as a guide for disaggregating soil map units to create soil series maps, identifying misplacement of polygon boundaries, identifying presence of inclusions, and correcting mislabeled polygons, when updating soil surveys.},

  abstract = {Soils contain a large and dynamic fraction of global terrestrial carbon stocks. The distribution of soil carbon (SC) with depth varies among ecosystems and land uses and is an important factor in calculating SC stocks and their vulnerabilities. Systematic analysis of SC depth distributions across databases of SC profiles has been challenging due to the heterogeneity of soil profile measurements, which vary in depth sampling. Here, we fit over 40,000 SC depth profiles to an exponential decline relationship with depth to determine SC concentration at the top of the mineral soil, minimum SC concentration at depth, and the characteristic “length” of SC concentration decline with depth. Fitting these parameters allowed profile characteristics to be analyzed across a large and heterogeneous dataset. We then assessed the differences in these depth parameters across soil orders and land cover types and between soil profiles with or without a history of tillage, as represented by the presence of an Ap horizon. We found that historically tilled soils had more gradual decreases of SC with depth (greater e-folding depth or Z∗), deeper SC profiles, lower SC concentrations at the top of the mineral soil, and lower total SC stocks integrated to 30 cm. The large database of profiles allowed these results to be confirmed across different land cover types and spatial areas within the Continental United States, providing robust evidence for systematic impacts of historical tillage on SC stocks and depth distributions.},

  abstract = {VandenBygaart, A. J. 2006. Monitoring soil organic carbon stock changes in agricultural landscapes: Issues and a proposed approach. Can. J. Soil Sci. 86: 451–463. The distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the landscape is governed by multiple factors and processes occurring at multiple scales. Thus, an understanding of landscape processes and pedology should aid in designing approaches to study SOC stock changes. Numerous factors affect distribution of SOC in the landscape at varying spatial and temporal scales. Each of these is summarized to set the stage for outlining a proposed approach to monitoring SOC in the agricultural landscape. Many tools are used to assess the variability of soil properties at varying spatial scales. Pedological knowledge and interpretation of landscape processes can be used to understand the spatial distribution of SOC in the landscape. I show that semi-variograms and the minimum detectable difference may be of limited value in deriving a universal approach to assess SOC change. Issues to be considered or resolved before initiating a monitoring system include depth of sampling and influence of management, compositing and sub-sampling, changes in bulk density, landscape effects and SOC dynamics. After considering these issues, I propose an approach to monitor SOC stock change in agroecosystems, acknowledging that any methodology likely cannot be strictly and universally applicable. The approach considers issues such as location, plot layout, and experimental and statistical design. Such an approach, derived from a landscape and pedology perspective, may make the measurement and verification of SOC at varying scales a less daunting task.},

  abstract = {Regional-scale assessment of soil C pools is essential to provide information for C cycling models, land management, and policy decisions, and elucidate the relative contribution of different C pools to total C (TC). We estimated TC and four soil C fractions, namely recalcitrant C (RC), hydrolyzable C (HC), hot-water-soluble C (SC), and mineralizable C (MC), at 0 to 30 cm across a 3585-km2 mixed-use watershed in north-central Florida. We used lognormal block kriging (BK) and regression block kriging (RK) to upscale soil C using 102 training samples and compared the models using 39 validation samples. Regression kriging produced the most accurate models for TC and RC, whereas the labile C fractions (HC, SC, and MC) were best modeled by BK. Maps produced by BK showed similar spatial patterns due to the strong correlation between the labile C fractions and the similarity of their spatial dependence structure. Estimates of TC and RC were similar due to their high correlation and the similarity of their global trend models. Total soil C amounted to 27.40 Tg across the watershed, indicating the potential of these soils to store C. Recalcitrant C totaled 22.49 Tg (82\% of TC), suggesting that a large amount of TC could be potentially stored for centuries to millennia. Our estimates of soil C and fractions within a mixed-use watershed in Florida highlight the importance of appropriately characterizing the inherent spatial dependence structure of soil C, as well as relevant regional environmental patterns (e.g., hydrology), to better explain the variability of soil C.},

Here we apply an innovative approach combining space-for-time substitution with meta-analysis to SOC measurements in 113,013 soil profiles across the globe to estimate the effect of future climate warming on steady-state SOC stocks. We find that SOC stock will reduce by 6.0 ± 1.6\% (mean±95\% confidence interval), 4.8 ± 2.3\% and 1.3 ± 4.0\% at 0–0.3, 0.3–1 and 1–2 m soil depths, respectively, under 1 °C air warming, with additional 4.2\%, 2.2\% and 1.4\% losses per every additional 1 °C warming, respectively. The largest proportional SOC losses occur in boreal forests. Existing SOC level is the predominant determinant of the spatial variability of SOC changes with higher percentage losses in SOC-rich soils. Our work demonstrates that warming induces more proportional SOC losses in topsoil than in subsoil, particularly from high-latitudinal SOC-rich systems.},

  abstract = {The Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) project was undertaken by the Soil Science Division of the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) to capture baseline soil carbon stocks across the conterminous US (CONUS). A multi-level hierarchical design was used to ensure that samples were distributed across regions, soils and land use/land cover classes (LULC). Within those strata, sites were selected at random locations where five pedons were described and sampled at 0-5 cm and by genetic horizon from 5 to 100 cm. A total of 6,148 sites, 32,084 pedons and 144,833 samples were described. Bulk density was calculated for samples from the upper 50 cm and predicted for deeper samples using pedon and horizon information in a regression tree developed with random forests. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was predicted for each sample using processed Visible-Near Infrared spectra and a random forest model. Pedon SOC stocks were calculated by fixed depth to 100 cm. Expected variance was introduced into the stock calculations using analytical and modeling prediction errors (e. g., SOC concentration and bulk density measurements) and the stratified sampling design was partitioned using a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. Pedons were averaged by site. The mean of all RaCA site SOC stocks to 100 cm was 321.1, with a median of 173.3 and range of 2 to over 5,000 Mg ha(-1). Geometric means of soil groups and LULC classes were used to extrapolate results to all assessed areas. Further work is needed to properly weight averages by areal extent and assess the cause of higher than expected site SOC stock values.},

  abstract = {Previous assessments of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have used soil maps and other tacit knowledge from soil survey to aggregate and extrapolate data without assessing the relationship between SOC and the tacit information used. The objective of this paper is to outline a process that translates tacit class-based knowledge into semiquantitative information about SOC stocks. This information was used to create a soil-based strata for sample selection to inventory SOC stocks. The process was completed in three steps: (i) official series descriptions (OSDs) were used to compile comprehensive soil information, (ii) an ordinal scoring system was developed and applied to link soil properties to likely SOC stocks, and (iii) hierarchical clustering was applied to cluster soils into groups for sampling. The scores and groups were tested using pedon SOC stocks from the National Cooperative Soil Survey laboratory database. Expert soil scientists interpreted individual terms used in Soil Taxonomy and OSDs for their explicit or implicit relationships with SOC stocks. Taxa, soil moisture regime, and temperature regime were separated as individual factors. Other information from the OSDs including family particle size class, depth to restrictive layer, and drainage class were used to translate qualitative information into ordinal scores. Classes for taxonomic order, soil moisture regimes, and drainage class were significantly different in pedon SOC stocks across and within regions. Scores within each factor (taxonomy, moisture regime, drainage class, temperature regime, and soil depth) were also significantly different from one another in pedon SOC stocks. Ordinal scores were used to cluster soils within each of 17 regions. Soil groups were significantly different from one another in SOC stocks in each of the 17 sampling regions. The process was considered satisfactory and was used to stratify soils for SOC stock sampling in the conterminous United States. A similar process could be applied to any soil property over any area of interest to evaluate tacit knowledge for communicating soil information, grouping soils for interpretation, or creating strata for distributing samples.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this second part of a two-part paper, the impacts of soil texture and vegetation type misclassification and their combined effect on soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and total runoff simulation are investigated using the Noah model. The results show that these impacts are significant for most regions and soil layers, although they vary depending on soil texture classification, vegetation type, and season. The use of site-observed soil texture classification and vegetation type in the model does not necessarily improve anomaly correlations and reduce mean absolute error for soil moisture simulations. Instead, results are mixed when examining all regions and soil layers. This is attributed to the compensation effects (e.g., effect of ill-calibrated model parameters), as Noah has been more or less calibrated with model-specified soil texture classification and vegetation type. The site-based analysis shows that Noah can reasonably simulate the variation of daily evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and total runoff when soil texture classification (vegetation type) is corrected from loam (forest) to clay (grasslands) or vice versa. This suggests that the performance of Noah can be further improved by tuning model parameters when site-observed soil texture and vegetation type are used.},

  abstract = {To explore how well large spatial scale digital soil mapping can contribute to efforts to monitor soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and changes, we reviewed regional and national studies quantifying SOC within lands dominated by agriculture using SCORPAN approaches that rely on soil (S), climate (C), organisms (O), relief (R), parent material (P), age (A), and space (N) covariates representing soil forming factors. After identifying 79 regional ({$>$} 10,000 km2) and national studies that attempted to estimate SOC, we evaluated model performances with reference to soil sampling depth, number of predictors, grid-distance, and spatial extent. SCORPAN covariates were then investigated in terms of their frequency of use and data sources. Lastly, we used 67 studies encompassing a variety of spatial scales to determine which covariates most influenced SOC in agricultural lands using a subjective ranking system. Topography (used in 94\% of the cases), climate (87\%), and organisms (86\%) covariates that were the most frequently used SCORPAN predictors, aligned with the factors (precipitation, temperature, elevation, slope, vegetation indices, and land use) currently identified to be most influential for model estimate at the large spatial extent. Models generally succeeded in estimating SOC with fits represented by R2 with a median value of 0.47 but, performance varied widely (R2 between 0.02 and 0.86) among studies. Predictive success declined significantly with increased soil sampling depth (p {$<$} 0.001) and spatial extent (p {$<$} 0.001) due to increased variability. While studies have extensively drawn on large-scale surveys and remote sensing databases to estimate environmental covariates, the absence of soils data needed to understand the influence of management or temporal change limits our ability to make useful inferences about changes in SOC stocks at this scale. This review suggests digital soil mapping efforts can be improved through greater use of data representing soil type and parent material and consideration of spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC occurring within different depths and land use or management systems.},

The regional biomass supply for a 20 MW bioelectricity facility is estimated using the Land Use and Resource Allocation (LURA) model. Results from LURA and data on regional forest management, harvesting, and processing are incorporated into the GHGs, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model for LCA. The results suggest that GHG emissions of mill residues-based pathways can be 15–52\% lower than those of pulpwood-based pathways, with logging residues falling in between. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that screening bioenergy projects on specific feedstock types alone is not sufficient because GHG emissions of a pulpwood-based pathway in one state can be lower than those of a mill residue-based pathway in another state. Furthermore, the available biomass supply often consists of several woody feedstocks, and its composition is region-dependent. Forest biomass-derived electricity is associated with 86–93\% lower life-cycle GHG emissions than the emissions of the average grid electricity in the U.S. Key factors driving bioelectricity GHG emissions include electricity generation efficiency, transportation distance, and energy use for biomass harvesting and processing.},

  abstract = {Post agricultural grasslands are considered to accumulate soil organic carbon (SOC) after cultivation cessation. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the U.S. is a wide scale, covering approximately 8.9 Mha as of 2020, example of row-crop to grassland conversion. To date, SOC sequestration rates, and potential, in CRP has mostly been evaluated at local scales and focused on the surface 20–30 cm of the soil profile. Thus, we lack knowledge of C sequestration rates in CRP lands on a continental scale and of C dynamics in the subsurface soil after agricultural cessation. The Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) project is the most recent effort by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to systematically quantify C stock in the 0-100 cm soil profiles across the conterminous US. Here we analyze data from RaCA to evaluate the C stocks of the CRP on a continental scale of both surface and subsurface soil. We found there was no difference in SOC stock between croplands and CRP lands when comparing the 0-100 cm soil profiles, which indicates that the C sequestration in CRP lands is insignificant overall. We did find that SOC accumulated in the surface soil (0–5 cm) in CRP lands. However, theses C gains in surface (0–5 cm) soil were offset by the lower SOC stock in the subsurface (30–100 cm) of the CRP. We also found that the C: N ratio in the subsurface soil in CRP lands is lower than that of croplands, indicating a lack of labile organic matter inputs in the subsoil. Whether the lower SOC in the subsurface of CRP is caused by legacy effects or is a result of C losses needs to be verified by long-term repeated sampling in both surface and subsurface soil. This analysis highlights the importance of examining C dynamics in subsurface soil after agricultural cessation to accurately measure and improve C sequestration rates in CRP lands.},

  abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine the effectiveness of artificial neural networks for the classification of bare soils, and to compare alternative neural network architectures. A group of classifiers, based on feed-forward back-propagation neural networks, was trained with either satellite or aerial remote sensing data. These classifiers were considered as either experts, trained to classify more than one soil texture, or specialists, trained to identify only one of the soil textures. Committee machines (CMs) and specialist committee machines (SCMs) were generated by applying a stacked generalization voting scheme. Both Landsat images and panchromatic aerial photographs, which were taken from bare-soil farmland in the Delta area of Mississippi, were used as spectral radiance sources. Sample points collected from two fields based on a 0.4ha (1acre) grid were split into two non-overlapping subsets serving as training and test sets. By including the spectral radiance values from pixels surrounding the pixels where soil sample points were located in the data sets, contextual information of those sample points was included in the training. The impacts of contextual information of the sample points were investigated by analyzing the relationship between classifiers’ performance and the size of input matrices that were used to collect spectral radiance data. The analysis showed that both CMs and SCMs performed better than any single classifier. In particular, the SCMs achieved the best performance by taking advantage of the generalization ability of CMs and the focusing ability of a specialist classifier. Both spectral radiance and contextual information of the samples played important roles in soil texture classification. Compared to panchromatic aerial photographs, training based on multispectral Landsat images led to better performance. Classifiers, and the CMs and SCMs generated accordingly, performed well when applied to test data sets that were collected from the same fields from which the training data sets were collected. They performed relatively poorly when applied to test data sets that were collected from the fields other than those from which the training data sets were collected.},

  abstract = {Significance                            Soil organic carbon (C) stock in Chinese croplands increased by about 140 kg C ha               −1               year               −1               from 1980 to 2011. This soil organic C sequestration was largely due to drastic changes in management practices, such as fertilization, tillage, and residue treatments, induced by economic and policy incentives. Our analysis also indicates that excessive N inputs and inability to incorporate residue C into deeper soils will likely constrain the future C sequestration in Chinese croplands. These findings provide new insights into the causes and limitations of economics- and policy-driven soil C sequestration in China and offer some guidance for soil C management in many developing countries that are going through the similar economic and social transformations.                        ,                             China’s croplands have experienced drastic changes in management practices, such as fertilization, tillage, and residue treatments, since the 1980s. There is an ongoing debate about the impact of these changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) and its implications. Here we report results from an extensive study that provided direct evidence of cropland SOC sequestration in China. Based on the soil sampling locations recorded by the Second National Soil Survey of China in 1980, we collected 4,060 soil samples in 2011 from 58 counties that represent the typical cropping systems across China. Our results showed that across the country, the average SOC stock in the topsoil (0–20 cm) increased from 28.6 Mg C ha               −1               in 1980 to 32.9 Mg C ha               −1               in 2011, representing a net increase of 140 kg C ha               −1               year               −1               . However, the SOC change differed among the major agricultural regions: SOC increased in all major agronomic regions except in Northeast China. The SOC sequestration was largely attributed to increased organic inputs driven by economics and policy: while higher root biomass resulting from enhanced crop productivity by chemical fertilizers predominated before 2000, higher residue inputs following the large-scale implementation of crop straw/stover return policy took over thereafter. The SOC change was negatively related to N inputs in East China, suggesting that the excessive N inputs, plus the shallowness of plow layers, may constrain the future C sequestration in Chinese croplands. Our results indicate that cropland SOC sequestration can be achieved through effectively manipulating economic and policy incentives to farmers.},

Although development of the U.S. Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), currently the most detailed level with a map scale ranging from 1:12 000 to 1:63 360, has involved substantial government funds and coordinated network efforts, very few studies have utilized it for soil carbon assessment at the large landscape scale. The objectives of this study were to 1) compare estimates in soil organic matter among SSURGO, the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO), and referenced field measurements at the soil map unit; 2) examine the influence of missing data on SOC estimation by SSURGO and STATSGO; 3) quantify spatial differences in SOC estimation between SSURGO and STATSGO, specifically for the state of Louisiana; and 4) assess scale effects on soil organic carbon density (SOCD) estimates from a soil map unit to a watershed and a river basin scale. SOC was estimated using soil attributes of SSURGO and STATSGO including soil organic matter (SOM) content, soil layer depth, and bulk density. Paired t-test, correlation, and regression analyses were performed to investigate various relations of SOC and SOM among the datasets. There were positive relations of SOC estimates between SSURGO and STATSGO at the soil map unit (R2 = 0.56, n = 86, t = 1.65, P = 0.102; depth: 30 cm). However, the SOC estimated by STATSGO were 9\%, 33\% and 36\% lower for the upper 30-cm, the upper 1-m, and the maximal depth (up to 2.75 m) soils, respectively, than those from SSURGO. The difference tended to increase as the spatial scale changes from the soil map unit to the watershed and river basin scales. Compared with the referenced field measurements, the estimates in SOM by SSURGO showed a closer match than those of STATSGO, indicating that the former was more accurate than the latter in SOC estimation, both in spatial and temporal resolutions. Further applications of SSURGO in SOC estimation for the entire United States could improve the accuracy of soil carbon accounting in regional and national carbon balances.},

This study was designed to examine the relationships of soil organic carbon (SOC) density to various terrain parameters and watershed characteristics across Louisiana, USA. A polygon data set of 484 watersheds and 12 river drainage basins for Louisiana was used to form the landscape units. SOC densities were calculated for each soil map unit using the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database. Average drainage densities and average slopes at watershed and basin scales were quantified with the 1:24~K Digital Elevation Models (DEM) data, and the Louisiana hydrographic water features. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to determine relationships among drainage density, slope, elevation, and SOC. The study found an average watershed drainage density of 1.6~km/km2 and an average watershed slope of 2.9 degrees in Louisiana. The results revealed that SOC density at both watershed and basin scales was closely related to drainage density, slope, and elevation. SOC density was positively correlated with watershed drainage density, but negatively correlated with watershed slope gradient and elevation. Regression models were developed for predicting SOC density at watershed and basin scales, obtaining regression coefficients (r2) ranging from 0.43 to 0.83. The study showed that estimation of SOC at watershed and drainage basin scales combining DEM data can be a feasible approach to improve the understanding of the relationships among SOC, topographic, and geomorphological features.},

  abstract = {Cropland carbon budget depicts the amount of carbon flowing in and out of agroecosystems and the changes in carbon stocks of soil and living biomass during the same period. Soil carbon credit is the additional change in soil carbon stock under certain farming practices compared with the business-as-usual practices. Accurately calculating cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit is critical to assessing climate change mitigation potential in agroecosystems. The calculation of cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit is sensitive to local soil and climatic conditions, especially initial soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, which is determined by both SOC concentration (SOC\%) and bulk density (Bulk\_Density). SOC stock data are either from soil sampling or gridded public survey data. In agroecosystem models, SOC stock data are a key model input for quantifying cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit. However, various types and degrees of uncertainties exist in SOC stock datasets, which propagate to the quantification of SOC stock change. In particular, a large discrepancy is found in two widely used SOC stock datasets — Rapid Carbon Assessment dataset (RaCA) and Gridded Soil Survey Geographic Database (gSSURGO) — in the U.S. Midwest, with a relative difference (quantified using Normalized Root Mean Square Error, NRMSE) of 48.0\% for 0–30~cm SOC stock between the two datasets. It remains largely unclear how uncertainty in SOC stocks affects the calculation of cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit. To address this question, we used a well-validated process-based agroecosystem model, ecosys, to assess the impacts of SOC stock uncertainty on carbon budget and soil carbon credit calculation in the U.S. Midwestern corn-soybean rotation systems. Our results reveal the following findings: (1) A sizable discrepancy exists in simulated cropland carbon budget between using gSSURGO and using RaCA for their SOC\% and Bulk\_Density as model inputs, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of only 0.4 for simulated change of SOC stock (ΔSOC) using these two different soil datasets. (2) Simulated cropland carbon budget components were more sensitive to initial SOC\% than to Bulk\_Density. For example, the upper and lower quartiles of multi-year averaged ΔSOC were −29.8 and 4.8 gC/m2/year for the selected counties respectively, with an uncertainty of 13.7 and 0.7 gC/m2/year induced by uncertainties in initial SOC\% and Bulk\_Density, respectively. (3) Both simulated ΔSOC and its uncertainty were negatively correlated with initial SOC\%, whereas ΔSOC was negatively correlated with air temperature, and ΔSOC uncertainty was positively correlated with air temperature. (4) The uncertainty of calculated soil carbon credits was much smaller compared with the uncertainty of calculated absolute carbon budgets assuming the same SOC stock uncertainty level in the inputs. Specifically, in our assessment comparing planting cover crops vs no cover crop, the uncertainty of calculated soil carbon credits induced by initial SOC\% uncertainty was less than 4\% (relative to the quantified value of the soil carbon credits) for 90\% of the cases. Our analysis highlights that high accuracy measurement of SOC\% as inputs is needed for the calculation of cropland carbon budgets; however, soil carbon credit quantification is much less sensitive to the initial SOC\% inputs, and the current publicly available soil datasets (e.g., gSSURGO) are largely suitable for the calculation of soil carbon credits.},

  abstract = {The role of soil organic carbon in global carbon cycles is receiving increasing attention both as a potentially large and uncertain source of CO2 emissions in response to predicted global temperature rises, and as a natural sink for carbon able to reduce atmospheric CO2. There is general agreement that the technical potential for sequestration of carbon in soil is significant, and some consensus on the magnitude of that potential. Croplands worldwide could sequester between 0.90 and 1.85 Pg C/yr, i.e. 26–53\% of the target of the “4p1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate”. The importance of intensively cultivated regions such as North America, Europe, India and intensively cultivated areas in Africa, such as Ethiopia, is highlighted. Soil carbon sequestration and the conservation of existing soil carbon stocks, given its multiple benefits including improved food production, is an important mitigation pathway to achieve the less than 2\,°C global target of the Paris Climate Agreement.},
