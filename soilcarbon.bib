	abstract = {Over the past fifty years, economists have developed methods for estimating the public benefits of green spaces, allowing such information to be incorporated into land use planning. But the extent to which it is ever used is unclear. This paper reviews the literature on public values for lands on urban outskirts, not just to survey their methods or empirical findings, but to evaluate the role they have played – or have the potential to play – in actual US land use plans. Based on interviews with authors and representatives of land trusts and governments, it appears that academic work has had a mixed reception in the policy world. Reasons include a lack of interest in making academic work accessible to policy makers, emphasizing revealed preference methods which ignore important non-use values, and emphasizing average values over distributions of values. Nevertheless, some success stories illustrate how such information can play a role in the design of conservation policies.},

	abstract = {Environmental valuation refers to a variety of techniques to assign monetary values to environmental impacts, especially non-market impacts. It has experienced a steady growth in the number of publications on the subject in the last 30 years. We performed a search for papers containing the term “environmental valuation” in the title, abstract, or keywords. The search was conducted with an online literature search engine of the Web of Science (WoS) electronic databases. A search of this database revealed that the term “environmental valuation” appeared for the first time in 1987. Since then a large number of studies have been published, including significant breakthroughs in theory and applications. In the present work 661 publications were selected for a review of the literature on environmental valuation over the period 1987–2019. This paper analyzes the evolution of the leading methodologies and authors, highlights the preference for the choice experiment method over the contingent valuation method, and shows that relatively few papers have had a strong impact on the researchers in this area.},

Perhaps surprisingly, economists did not consider measures like consumer surplus, which seemed quite foreign. Consequently, when they turned to nonmarket valuation for goods like outdoor recreation, their constructed demand curves seemed less informative than a simple equilibrium price. As they struggled with how to make use of such information, natural resource economists set important precedents for the larger profession in coming to consumer surplus as a new measure of benefits. By creating important precedents and learning through practice, they shaped the discipline as much as they were shaped by received theory. At the same time, by coming to these notions in the context of political debates, they were also shaped by the norms of the state.},

Economists have developed non-market approaches to address difficult issues related to valuation of the environment. This paper reviews recent literature on non-market valuation as applied to wetlands, with a particular focus on the value of urban wetlands. Wetland valuation studies have generated a wide range of values, in part due to differences in what is valued and in part due to differences in methodology. Several studies have shown that property owners value proximity to wetlands in urban areas. In addition, studies have found positive values for recreation (fishing and hunting), commercial fishing, water purification, and other ecosystem services provided by wetlands, although little of this work has been done on urban wetlands. Valuation studies can provide useful information about relative rankings of value, showing, for example, that certain types of wetlands or certain services are more highly valued than others. Whether the absolute magnitude of valuation estimates is correct is less clear.},

            The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it significant changes to human mobility patterns and working environments. We aimed to explore how social distancing measures affected recreational use of urban green space during the partial lockdown in Oslo, Norway. Mobile tracking data from thousands of recreationists were used to analyze high resolution spatio-temporal changes in activity. We estimated that outdoor recreational activity increased by 291\% during lockdown relative to a 3 yr average for the same days. This increase was significantly greater than expected after adjusting for the prevailing weather and time of year and equates to approx. 86 000 extra activities per day over the municipality (population of 690 000). Both pedestrians (walking, running, hiking) and cyclists appeared to intensify activity on trails with higher greenviews and tree canopy cover, but with differences in response modulated by trail accessibility and social distancing preferences. The magnitude of increase was positively associated with trail remoteness, suggesting that green spaces facilitated social distancing and indirectly mitigated the spread of COVID-19. Finally, pedestrian activity increased in city parks, peri-urban forest, as well as protected areas, highlighting the importance of access to green open spaces that are interwoven within the built-up matrix. These findings shed new light on the value of urban nature as resilience infrastructure during a time of crisis. The current pandemic also reveals some important dilemmas we might face regarding green justice on the path towards urban planning for future sustainable cities.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Outdoor and nature-based recreation provides countless social benefits, yet public land managers often lack information on the spatial and temporal extent of recreation activities. Social media is a promising source of data to fill information gaps because the amount of recreational use is positively correlated with social media activity. However, despite the implication that these correlations could be employed to accurately estimate visitation, there are no known transferable models parameterized for use with multiple social media data sources. This study tackles these issues by examining the relative value of multiple sources of social media in models that estimate visitation at unmonitored sites and times across multiple destinations. Using a novel dataset of over 30,000 social media posts and 286,000 observed visits from two regions in the United States, we compare multiple competing statistical models for estimating visitation. We find social media data substantially improve visitor estimates at unmonitored sites, even when a model is parameterized with data from another region. Visitation estimates are further improved when models are parameterized with on-site counts. These findings indicate that while social media do not fully substitute for on-site data, they are a powerful component of recreation research and visitor management.},

	abstract = {Visitation counts are the measures most widely used by park managers to demonstrate accountability and good stewardship of the public resources that legislatures invest in parks. This paper describes a procedure implemented in Texas State Parks for addressing the technical aspect of this important problem. To transpose raw axle count numbers into visitation estimates, two parameters have to be calculated: (i) the proportion of axles attributable to visitors, as opposed to officials, staff, vendors, or visitors re-entering the park on the same day; and (ii) the average number of visitors per axle. A study was conducted for a 12 month period in 92 Texas state parks, during which time observers diligently recorded the data relating to these variables. As a result of the study, these empirically-derived parameters could be used by each park site to more accurately transpose its axle counts to visitation estimates. Two major findings emerged from the study. First, the parameter estimates varied widely among the 92 parks, whereas, for years, the same values had been applied system-wide. Second, the empirical values were substantially lower than those which had traditionally been used by the agency. Empirical verification of the parameter values used in visitor estimation formulas can improve the veracity of patron counts and subsequently increase an agency’s credibility in the eyes of legislators.},

However, the information available on individual users is limited and typically does not include provenance, restricting the potential applications and impact of the data. Here we investigate a meth­ odology to estimate social media visitors’ home locations at various spatial scales and apply it to the entire network of national parks in Germany. We compare predicted visitor provenance to representative onsite survey data and explore group-specific spatial and temporal patterns of recreation as characterised by users’ geotagged photographs. Results show that photograph metadata can be used to assign home locations with accuracies between 62 and 89\% depending on spatial scale implemented. Said social media-based predictions are reason­ ably well representative of the surveyed visitor structure in German national parks with Flickr visitor-days composed of 19\% local, 62\% non-local German and 19\% international visits.},

We analyze visitors’ demand for nature-based recreation in the Apalachicola River region of Florida using the travel cost method. The results from a count data regression model reveal that on average visitors would pay \$74.18 per visit-day for nature-based recreation resulting in a total economic value of \$484.56 million attributable to nature-based recreation in the Apalachicola River region. Results of this study provide useful information for natural resources management in the region and a rationale to preserve Florida’s unique ecosystems.},

A greater appreciation and understanding of ecosystem services, including both use and non-use services, may have avoided misguided resource management decisions in the past that resulted in negative legacies inherited by future generations. Given the interest in ecosystem services and lack of a coherent approach to addressing this topic in the Great Lakes, a summit was convened involving 28 experts working on various aspects of ecosystem services in the Great Lakes. The invited attendees spanned a variety of social and natural sciences. Given the unique status of the Great Lakes as the world's largest collective repository of surface freshwater, and the numerous stressors threatening this valuable resource, timing was propitious to examine ecosystem services. Several themes and recommendations emerged from the summit. There was general consensus that: 1) a comprehensive inventory of ecosystem services throughout the Great Lakes is a desirable goal but would require considerable resources; 2) more spatially and temporally intensive data are needed to overcome our data gaps, but the arrangement of data networks and observatories must be well-coordinated; 3) trade-offs must be considered as part of ecosystem services analyses; and 4) formation of a Great Lakes Institute for Ecosystem Services, to provide a hub for research, meetings, and training is desirable. Several challenges also emerged during the summit, which are discussed.},

The ecosystem services provided by Lake Erie, however, are under threat due to harmful algal blooms. This paper provides recreational damage estimates using spatially and temporally varying algae measures and monthly ﬁshing permit sales collected between 2011 and 2014. Results indicate that ﬁshing license sales drop between 10\% and 13\% when algal conditions surpass the World Health's Organization's moderate health risk advisory threshold of 20,000 cyanobacteria cells/mL. For Lake Erie adjacent counties experiencing a large, summer-long algal bloom, this would result in approximately 3600 fewer ﬁshing licenses issued and approximately \$2.25 million to \$5.58 million in lost ﬁshing expenditures. Our results show a discrete jump in reduced angling activity upon crossing this threshold, with limited additional impacts associated with more severe algal blooms. This suggests that policies aimed at eliminating, rather than mitigating, algal levels are most beneﬁcial to the Ohio angling industry.},

Using a mail survey of 767 Ohio Lake Erie recreational angler respondents and a choice experiment, this study provides the ﬁrst empirical quantiﬁcation of the economic impacts of HABs on U.S. recreational anglers. Our results demonstrate a signiﬁcant and substantial willingness to pay by anglers for reduction in HABs, beyond the beneﬁts associated with conventional water quality measures such as catch rates and water clarity. For instance, we ﬁnd that anglers are willing to pay \$8 to \$10 more per trip for one less mile of boating through HABs en route to a ﬁshing site. This ﬁnding suggests that explicit measures of HABs need to be collected and considered when valuing water quality in nutrient-rich bodies of water. We evaluate the welfare improvements resulting from several nutrient reduction policies, and ﬁnd that anglers are willing to pay on average \$40 to \$60 per trip for a policy that cuts upstream phosphorus loadings by 40\%. The majority of welfare gains for anglers result from improving the non-catchable component of the ﬁshing experience, notably water clarity and HAB reduction, as opposed to better chances of angler success.},

The truncated count data estimators and their properties are reviewed. A large sample (N = 2223) allowed random segmenting of the data into specification, estimation, and out-of-sample prediction portions. Statistics of interest are therefore unbiased by the specification search, and the prediction results allow comparison of the statistical models' robustness. The new estimators are found to be more appropriate for estimating and predicting demand and social benefits than the alternative estimators based on a variety of criteria.},

	abstract = {Recreational ﬁshing value of the Brazilian Pantanal is measured using travel cost method (TCM). We compare non-linear, Poisson and negative binomial count data models to estimate recreational ﬁshing trip demands. The count data and truncated models are used primarily to account for non-negative integer and truncation properties of recreational ﬁshing trips as suggested by the recreation valuation literature. The results reveal that non-linear and truncated count data models perform relatively well in our study. The economic values of recreational ﬁshing in terms of consumer surplus (CS) are derived using non-linear and truncated models. We estimate the CS values from \$540.54 to \$869.57 per trip resulting in the total social welfare estimate range from \$35 to \$56 million. The study demonstrates a relatively high value of recreational ﬁshing in the Pantanal in comparison to similar studies conducted in other parts of the world. The ﬁndings of this study would be important for resource management decisions in the Pantanal and could serve as a reference in valuing similar resources in other ecosystems around the world. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Most random utility recreation demand models implicitly assume that all relevant site characteristics are observed by the researcher or allow for the possibility of unobserved characteristics in a restrictive manner. Unlike traditional approaches, the proposed model avoids the bias unobserved site characteristics can cause in welfare estimates and the travel cost parameter. Monte Carlo simulations motivate the proposed model by showing that it provides more efﬁcient parameter estimates. In contrast, existing methods yield less efﬁcient estimates and biased standard errors that overstate precision. An empirical application to recreational ﬁshing in Wisconsin illustrates the potential importance of this modeling innovation. In this application, controlling for unobserved characteristics is important for a range of model speciﬁcations.},

They were also used to calculate social bene®ts from local reductions in air pollution and international agreements on reduced air emissions of acid compounds. The Norwegian Fishing and Hunting Association (NJFF) also successfully used the results to increase the governmental funds for liming by 300\% between 1993 and 1995. The NJFF have since used these results to ®ght reductions in the liming budget, and has managed to keep it constant at about 13.5 million annually.

	abstract = {Demographic and environmental factors can influence the spatial distribution of fish populations, potentially affecting the timing, location, and magnitude of harvest. Quantifying these relationships can be complicated, if their effects vary spatially over a population’s range or are non-additive (i.e., interactive), where one factor mediates the effect of another. Toward understanding the relative influence of demographic and environmental factors on fishery harvest in large freshwater lakes, we used varying-coefficient generalized additive models to explore the existence of non-additive, spatially-dependent effects of adult population size and thermal conditions on recreational harvest patterns of Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus) during 2006-2015. We identified nonlinear, additive, and generally positive effects of thermal conditions and adult population size on harvest rates. Their effects were, however, spatially-dependent, the accounting of which can help explain inter-annual and intraannual variation in lake-wide harvest rates. Specifically, harvest rates increased more with increasing cumulative degree days in the eastern portion of the central basin, especially offshore, relative to the rest of the study area. Harvest rates also increased more with increasing walleye population size in the southwest portion of the west basin and the middle of the central basin compared to other study areas. As in marine ecosystems, our findings demonstrate the benefit of using modeling approaches that consider the spatial dependency of harvest rate on demographic and environmental factors to understanding broader harvest dynamics in large lakes. Their use could help managers and policy-makers ensure the sustained use of valued freshwater fish populations amidst demographic and environmental change.},

A steelhead angler intercept survey was conducted in fall, winter, and spring of 2002–2003. Almost 77\% of the anglers surveyed (375) responded to a mail survey with useful information. Typical steelhead anglers were 46 years old, middle class, male, and had 9 years steelhead angling experience. Less than two-thirds of respondents fished with spinning tackle and one-third used fly tackle. On average, individuals traveled with 1.7 people in their group. They mostly took single day trips (94\% of respondents), traveling approximately 84 kilometers round trip. Steelhead catch rates are positively related to number of trips taken, angler experience, number of streams visited per trip, number of hours fished per trip, and type of tackle used. The value of the steelhead angling experience to participating anglers is estimated at \$36 to \$46 per trip while the money spent to participate in steelhead fishing is estimated at \$26 per trip. Annual value of the Lake Erie tributary steelhead fishery in Ohio could be as high as \$12 to \$14 million compared to the \$600,000 cost for the stocking program. The fishery provides economic benefits to the coastal areas where adequate access for stream steelhead anglers exists during parts of the year when recreational demand is lowest. This information can be used by policy makers to justify expenditures on stocking, public access, and water quality improvements that enhance angling.},

In this article, we describe the recreation demand model developed on behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for use in valuing lost shoreline recreational user days attributable to the spill. The unprecedented magnitude of the disruption caused by the spill led to a variety of challenges. We estimate a model of shoreline recreation trips to the Gulf Coast region from the general population of the lower 48 states, combining single and multiple-day trips, calculating travel costs that incorporate detailed information on flying costs and transportation mode choice, and using alternative-specific constants to control for site characteristics. Losses per recreation day are assessed by evaluating the impact of utility adjustments that exactly reproduce the proportional decline in recreation observed through on-site counts gathered throughout the Gulf in the years following the spill. Estimated losses from the primary shoreline study are \$520 million out of the total recreational damages of \$661 million (2015 \$).},

	abstract = {Sex- and size-specific reproductive behaviors can increase the vulnerability of certain demographic components of fish populations to exploitation, potentially leading to unsustainable harvest. Lake Erie’s largest walleye (Sander vitreus) spawning population, which aggregates on the Ohio reef complex during spring, is subject to angling. Information on the sex composition of harvest or how reproductive behavior might influence harvest is lacking. To address these uncertainties, we implanted 337 reef-spawning individuals with acoustic transmitters, and their spawning behavior on the reef complex was monitored for 4 years using acoustic telemetry. Males arrived on spawning grounds earlier and remained on them longer than females. These behavioral differences led us to predict that recreational angler harvest during the spawning season would be male-biased. Creel surveys confirmed this prediction, although sex composition of the harvest was influenced by angling technique. Collectively, these findings suggest that sex-based differences in reproductive behaviors bias the recreational harvest toward males on the reef complex during the spawning season. This male-biased harvest seems unlikely to pose an undue risk to Lake Erie’s walleye fishery.},

Of interest to applied researchers, our results quantify the tradeoffs between model run-time, accuracy, and precision of welfare estimates associated with samples of different sizes. Moreover, although our results confirm that larger efficiency losses arise with smaller samples as theory would predict, they also suggest that depending on researcher needs, random samples as small as 28 alternatives (5\% of the full set of alternatives in our application) can produce relatively accurate welfare estimates that are useful for exploratory modeling, sensitivity analysis, and policy purposes.},

Costs that are fixed in the short run, such as expenses for equipment that is used over multiple trips, are typically ignored and implicitly netted out. The resulting net value of recreation trips, or consumer surplus, is appropriate for long-run analysis when consumers can fully adjust their expenditures. However, in cases where some costs are difficult to adjust in the short run, such as when boat owners do not sell their boats in response to the transient effects of an oil spill, traditional consumer surplus measures underestimate the total welfare change. We explain this underestimation and show how to correct for it by adjusting traditional consumer surplus estimates upward. We illustrate our procedure using a model of recreational boating developed to assess damages from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In that case, accounting for boating fixed costs resulted in a 50\% increase in estimated value relative to estimates of consumer surplus alone.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades there has been a re-emergence of regular harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie due to increasing phosphorus loading, mainly from non-point agricultural sources. The Canadian and United States governments have jointly agreed to reduce phosphorus loadings to the lake in order to control the extent and severity of the blooms. Citizens on both sides of the border face a number of economic costs, both market and non-market, as a result of the blooms. This study values these costs for the Canadian portion of the Lake Erie basin economy using standard economic approaches that are widely applied within the world of cost-benefit analysis. The results suggest that algal blooms will impose equivalent annual costs equal to \$272 million in 2015 prices over a 30-year period if left unchecked. The largest market costs will be imposed on the tourism industry (\$110 million in equivalent annual costs) and the largest non-market costs will be borne by recreational users and those who place inherent value on the lake’s quality (\$115 million in equivalent annual costs). Management action to reduce phosphorus loadings is found to be justified on economic grounds if the 30-year net present value of the reduction program is less than \$1294 million (2015 Canadian dollars).},

This study quantitatively examines the linkages among variations in climate, agricultural yields, and people's migration responses by using an instrumental variables approach. Our method allows us to identify the relationship between crop yields and migration without explicitly controlling for all other confounding factors. Using state-level data from Mexico, we find a significant effect of climate-driven changes in crop yields on the rate of emigration to the United States. The estimated semielasticity of emigration with respect to crop yields is approximately −0.2, i.e., a 10\% reduction in crop yields would lead an additional 2\% of the population to emigrate. We then use the estimated semielasticity to explore the potential magnitude of future emigration. Depending on the warming scenarios used and adaptation levels assumed, with other factors held constant, by approximately the year 2080, climate change is estimated to induce 1.4 to 6.7 million adult Mexicans (or 2\% to 10\% of the current population aged 15–65 y) to emigrate as a result of declines in agricultural productivity alone. Although the results cannot be mechanically extrapolated to other areas and time periods, our findings are significant from a global perspective given that many regions, especially developing countries, are expected to experience significant declines in agricultural yields as a result of projected warming.},

A recent survey of over 800 single-day beach visitors during the summer of 1998 found that nearly two thirds of visitors take advantage of this information when making decisions about their beach trips. When accounting for this information in a travel cost model, we find that the average (across all visitors) seasonal benefits of reducing one advisory is approximately 28 per visitor. Individuals who use the media in advance of trips gain less, approximately 24 per year, while those who use only signs posted at the beach would gain more, \$38 per year.},

	abstract = {Public policies that lead to a reduction in the emissions of air and water pollutants or the protection of sensitive ecosystems presumably increase the well-being of many members of society. Applied welfare economists are accustomed to measuring the welfare effects of policies that invoke price changes. If it is granted that the public good attributes of most dimensions of environmental quality preclude the development of well functioning markets for these service flows, how are the monetary values of changes in environmental quality to be measured? The past twenty to thirty years have seen the rapid development of the economic theory and techniques for measuring the demands for nonmarketed goods, and in this chapter we attempt to sketch out the major results. We review the basic concept of economic welfare and derive measures of welfare change for both changes in prices of market goods and changes in quantities and qualities of nonmarket goods. We then describe the principal economic techniques for estimating the benefits of environmental quality improvements when these improvements either directly affect individuals' well-being or indirectly affect individuals through constraints they face. Perhaps the major class of measurement methods is based on the observation that changes in environmental quality may cause individuals to alter purchases of goods and services that are complements or substitutes for environmental quality in their preference orderings. These revealed preference methods are the primary focus of this chapter. A second major approach to obtaining estimates of the benefits and costs of environmental changes, stated preference methods, are addressed in detail in later chapters. Our treatment of welfare effects places special emphasis on the connection between the underlying economic theory and practical empirical models.},

Our results are consistent with the Easterlin Paradox that has been reported in the literature. We find that high-income groups are less likely to belong in the highest SWB level, which could be partly explained by the fact that the relative income status (rather than the absolute one) is more important in determining (the highest level of) SWB.},

	abstract = {Background
Non-fatal health outcomes from diseases and injuries are a crucial consideration in the promotion and monitoring of individual and population health. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies done in 1990 and 2000 have been the only studies to quantify non-fatal health outcomes across an exhaustive set of disorders at the global and regional level. Neither effort quantified uncertainty in prevalence or years lived with disability (YLDs).
Methods
Of the 291 diseases and injuries in the GBD cause list, 289 cause disability. For 1160 sequelae of the 289 diseases and injuries, we undertook a systematic analysis of prevalence, incidence, remission, duration, and excess mortality. Sources included published studies, case notification, population-based cancer registries, other disease registries, antenatal clinic serosurveillance, hospital discharge data, ambulatory care data, household surveys, other surveys, and cohort studies. For most sequelae, we used a Bayesian meta-regression method, DisMod-MR, designed to address key limitations in descriptive epidemiological data, including missing data, inconsistency, and large methodological variation between data sources. For some disorders, we used natural history models, geospatial models, back-calculation models (models calculating incidence from population mortality rates and case fatality), or registration completeness models (models adjusting for incomplete registration with health-system access and other covariates). Disability weights for 220 unique health states were used to capture the severity of health loss. YLDs by cause at age, sex, country, and year levels were adjusted for comorbidity with simulation methods. We included uncertainty estimates at all stages of the analysis.
Findings
Global prevalence for all ages combined in 2010 across the 1160 sequelae ranged from fewer than one case per 1 million people to 350 000 cases per 1 million people. Prevalence and severity of health loss were weakly correlated (correlation coefficient −0·37). In 2010, there were 777 million YLDs from all causes, up from 583 million in 1990. The main contributors to global YLDs were mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes or endocrine diseases. The leading specific causes of YLDs were much the same in 2010 as they were in 1990: low back pain, major depressive disorder, iron-deficiency anaemia, neck pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, anxiety disorders, migraine, diabetes, and falls. Age-specific prevalence of YLDs increased with age in all regions and has decreased slightly from 1990 to 2010. Regional patterns of the leading causes of YLDs were more similar compared with years of life lost due to premature mortality. Neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and anaemia were important causes of YLDs in sub-Saharan Africa.
Interpretation
Rates of YLDs per 100 000 people have remained largely constant over time but rise steadily with age. Population growth and ageing have increased YLD numbers and crude rates over the past two decades. Prevalences of the most common causes of YLDs, such as mental and behavioural disorders and musculoskeletal disorders, have not decreased. Health systems will need to address the needs of the rising numbers of individuals with a range of disorders that largely cause disability but not mortality. Quantification of the burden of non-fatal health outcomes will be crucial to understand how well health systems are responding to these challenges. Effective and affordable strategies to deal with this rising burden are an urgent priority for health systems in most parts of the world.

Both volunteering through organizations and directly for individuals are considered. Different approaches to valuation, including the replacement cost, opportunity cost, and social benefits approaches and both observed and reported market proxies, are examined. Based on a number of criteria, the replacement cost method using observed market wages is recommended. Using this method, the article estimates that ‘volunteerland,’ if it were its own country, would have the second largest adult population of any country in the world, and would be the world's seventh largest economy. The article concludes by discussing a new International Labour Organization Manual on the Measurement of Volunteer Work that adopts the basic method for defining and valuing volunteer work outlined here and promises to generate a much more robust and coherent body of data on volunteer work than has ever been available both globally and nationally.},

	abstract = {The current literature often values intangible goods like cultural heritage by applying stated preference methods. In recent years, however, the increasing availability of large databases on real estate transactions and listed prices has opened up new research possibilities and has reduced various existing barriers to applications of conventional (spatial) hedonic analysis to the real estate market. The present paper provides one of the first applications using a spatial autoregressive model to investigate the impact of cultural heritage—in particular, listed buildings and historic–cultural sites (or historic landmarks)—on the value of real estate in cities. In addition, this paper suggests a novel way of specifying the spatial weight matrix—only prices of sold houses influence current price—in identifying the spatial dependency effects between sold properties. The empirical application in the present study concerns the Dutch urban area of Zaanstad, a historic area for which over a long period of more than 20 years detailed information on individual dwellings, and their market prices are available in a GIS context. In this paper, the effect of cultural heritage is analysed in three complementary ways. First, we measure the effect of a listed building on its market price in the relevant area concerned. Secondly, we investigate the value that listed heritage has on nearby property. And finally, we estimate the effect of historic–cultural sites on real estate prices. We find that, to purchase a listed building, buyers are willing to pay an additional 26.9 \%, while surrounding houses are worth an extra 0.28 \% for each additional listed building within a 50-m radius. Houses sold within a conservation area appear to gain a premium of 26.4 \% which confirms the existence of a ‘historic ensemble’ effect.},

We contrast this with DCEs that have a long-standing, well-tested theoretical basis in random utility theory, and we show why and how DCEs are more general and consistent with economic demand theory. Perhaps the major message, though, is that many studies that claim to be doing conjoint analysis are really doing DCE.},

A number of choice modelling methods are consistent with consumer theory, and its focus on an attribute-based theory of value permits a superior representation of many environmental management contexts. However, choice modelling surveys can place a severe cognitive burden upon respondents and induce satisficing rather than maximising behavioural patterns. In this framework, we seek to identify the best available choice modelling alternative and investigate its potential to ‘solve’ some of the major biases associated with standard contingent valuation. We then discuss its use in the light of policy appraisal needs within the EU. An application to the demand for rock climbing in Scotland is provided as an illustration.},

Recent research has questioned the assumption that consumers posses fixed and well-defined preference orderings for such goods and suggests that individuals may need to form values for unfamiliar goods during the CV exercise itself. In this paper, we investigate how and why WTP is influenced by time to think, differing information levels and the opportunity to deliberate in a group setting for an unfamiliar good (red kite reintroduction) and a familiar good (green energy from wind power). For the Red Kite Project, we find that after several rounds of valuation final mean WTP is significantly different from initial mean WTP and that information, time to think and the opportunity to deliberate all influenced the valuation process. For the familiar good (wind power), mean WTP is not significantly different. Our overall conclusion is that whilst “one-shot” CV surveys may be appropriate for environmental goods that are familiar to participants (e.g. recreation benefits), they are not appropriate for less familiar goods (rare species) where the CV exercise should act as a ‘preference engine’ by giving participants time to think, information sufficient to their needs, and the opportunity to deliberate.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for modeling switching behavior using simultaneously cross-sectional revealed preference (RP) data and stated intentions, a type of stated preference (SP) data. With explicit consideration of biases and random errors potentially contained in SP data, combined estimation with RP and SP data can exploit the advantages of both data sources. An empirical analysis of commuters' mode choice shows that the stated intention data have predictive validity if their biases and errors are properly corrected.},

	abstract = {The sporting success of athletes and national teams is associated with a feel-good-factor among the population. These positive social effects can be regarded as public goods that entail a certain value for the population. The value of public or non-market goods can be estimated using the contingent valuation method (CVM). A theoretical model is developed based on the consumption capital theory. This model explains the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for winning the 2010 Football World Cup as a function of sport-related and football-specific consumption capital as well as intangible and socio-economic factors. Within a survey of German citizens (n=3049), the value of winning the 2010 Football World Cup is assessed using CVM. The model is tested using regression analyses to identify the significant determinants of WTP. The results reveal half of the respondents stated a WTP that amounted to €26 on average. The findings of a mixed-effects logistic as well as an alternative Tobit regression model show that intangible factors such as identification with the country and with the national team as well as individual and national importance of a good result significantly influence individuals’ WTP. Based on the findings of this study, it can be recommended that policy makers invest in national teams and athletes as national sporting success can generate a feel-good-factor among the population and make people happier. Additionally, it can impact on peoples’ perceptions and expectations about current and future economic situations which in turn determine macro-economic outcomes. Moreover, such estimations could be integrated into cost-benefit terms that are carried out for sport events.},

The valuation of the wave through this methodology is a key tool to obtain the minimum economic value unallocated to the market, allowing to understand the true value of the presence of this abiotic resource of high uniqueness. The data collected carried out with 432 surveys made during August and September on the beaches of Costa de Caparica in 2011. One of the findings of the study was the recognition of the waves used directly by surfers, as a resource for the local economy by all users. Many of the users understood that their disappearance would be negative, since Costa de Caparica has an associated mass clients surfing contribution. As for the economic value it is estimated that the waves may be worth between €46 635.12 and €1 022 789.52 from an estimation of 22 000 surfers that attend annually. This paper demonstrates the importance of Costa de Caparica's waves in social and economical analyses and the need to consider them as a potential resource, for which the negative impacts could be damaging both local community and economy.},

	abstract = {Marine and coastal ecosystems – and thus the benefits they create for humans – are subject to increasing pressures and competing usages. For this reason, the European Union (EU) adopted the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), which is to guide future maritime policy in the EU and aims at achieving or maintaining a good environmental status (GES) of European seas by 2020. To this end, the MSFD requires the development of improvement measures, which have to be assessed inter alia by examining their cost-effectiveness and by carrying out cost-benefit analysis (CBA) before their implementation. This paper investigates the applicability of environmental CBA in the marine context. It identifies and discusses problems that could hamper the environmental effectiveness of the MSFD. For example, the fact that marine ecosystem services are much less tangible than terrestrial ones implies greater challenges for the quantification of benefits for society in a marine context. One finding is that the limitations of environmental valuation methods regarding their ability to capture the whole total economic value of improvement measures are a potential source of problems, as the MSFD allows countries to disregard measures with disproportionately high costs. The trans-boundary nature of the main European seas adds to the complexity of the valuation task, e.g., due to the danger that benefits that occur outside of national territories are neglected. Moreover, the current state of knowledge on the functioning of complex marine ecosystems and the links to socio-economic impacts and human well-being seem insufficient to meet the MSFD requirements.},

The RV method has become more and more popular recently, and has been found to lead to very different estimation results than conventional RU models. Previous studies have reported these differences but did not explain them, which limited the confidence in the RV model as a useful foundation for transport policy analysis. In this paper, we first analytically show in what way exactly the two models are different and why they may generate different estimation results. Based on this deeper understanding of the connection and difference between the two models, we formulate hypotheses regarding the conditions under which differences in estimation results are expected to be smaller or larger. Using synthetic data, we empirically test these expectations. Results provide strong support for our hypotheses, allowing us to derive a number of practical recommendations for analysts interested in using the RV and RU models in their VTTC-analysis.},

	abstract = {This article reviews published research that has focused on the recreational fishing site choices made by anglers. A conceptual model for predicting fishing site choice is developed by synthesizing the findings from past studies that employed fishing site choice models. From these and other relevant studies, six general attributes (i.e., costs, fishing quality, environmental quality, facility development, encounters with other anglers, and regulations) are identified that may influence an angler’s selection of a fishing site. The article also enhances the conceptual model by accounting for differing preferences among anglers, for complex substitution patterns among fishing sites, for fishing participation decisions, for habit forming behaviors and for differences in anglers’ awareness levels for fishing sites. Finally, the article discusses several avenues that researchers could exploit to improve on past fishing site choice model studies. The author is grateful to two anonymous reviewers for their very insightful comments and suggestions that were used to greatly improve an earlier version of this article. The author also thanks Barry Boots and Peter Boxall for their constructive comments and discussions about recreational fishing site choice model studies. Finally, the author acknowledges the support provided by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and the Living Legacy Trust that provided the opportunity to write this article.},

With a nested logit framework, the models tested whether anglers have an unobserved tendency to substitute between fishing sites based on target species or lake-specific preferences. Results indicated that anglers tend to substitute more readily between sites within a lake, although we found that the choice of model did not qualitatively influence measures of nonmarket value. Both models predicted that the fishing destinations of anglers would be strongly influenced by catch rates. Using these results, we estimated the sportfishing value for several fish species and found that anglers have the highest willingness to pay for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Coho Salmon O. kisutch, steelhead O. mykiss, and Walleyes Sander vitreus. We also derived the access values of Michigan's coastal fishing sites and determined that day trips to a typical Great Lake site are worth about \$30 per trip.

Exploratory factor analyses reveal a mosaic of race‐ and gender‐based meanings assigned to fishing. The most marked differences are present between racial groups, although gender contributed conceptually to meaning structures. More similarities than differences in meanings are present among anglers. The results underscore the importance of going beyond an examination of leisure participation rates and issues of choice among minority groups to broader concerns of the meanings of such activities. A discussion of the theoretical significance of place and subculture highlights the role of race and gender in creating meanings of leisure. Natural resource managers are encouraged to consider the meanings placed on leisure and recreation activities by racial and gender groups.},

However, it has yet to be determined whether the increasing importance of recreational fishing is a general trend of marine fisheries in the US or whether such a trend is limited to only those species recognized as popular recreational fishes. 71\% of marine species in the US have experienced an increase in the proportion of total harvest from the recreational sector during the time harvest data are available for both sectors. Species demonstrating an increase in the proportion of harvests by the recreational sector included those generally regarded as commercial, bait, and bycatch species, as well as those considered recreational species. Marine species categorized as overfished could not be predicted from either fishery characteristics or life history characteristics in a PCA analysis of available data for fished species in the US. Consequently, there appears to be little to predict vulnerability of populations to fishing efforts save that all fished species can be made vulnerable to overexploitation. Well-developed yield-based strategies, designed for commercial fisheries, are not likely to be effective in managing populations as the diverse recreational fishing sector continues to increase in its importance. Thus, new management strategies for US marine fisheries are needed. Some possible alternative strategies are discussed.},

The top five states in numbers of resident fishing days exported to other states were Illinois, Texas, Pennsylvania, California, and Virginia. A stakeholder perspective including managers and resident anglers is presented to illustrate the diversity of thought on the fishing as tourism issue. Ecotourism is defined, illustrated with examples, and offered as a future means for coping with the fishing days being exported to various states.

The hypothetical nature of environmental valuation surveys typically results in responses that are significantly greater than actual payments. Economists have had mixed success in developing techniques designed to control for this “hypothetical bias.” This paper highlights the role of experimental economics in addressing hypothetical bias, and identifies a gap in the existing literature by focusing on the underlying causes of this bias. Most of the calibration techniques used today lack a theoretical justification, and therefore these procedures need to be used with caution. We argue that future experimental research should investigate the reasons hypothetical bias persists. A better understanding of the causes should enhance the effectiveness of calibration techniques.},

The main source of bacteria derives from a drainage ditch that discharges near the beach. We have conducted a comprehensive study to determine the feasibility of using a constructed wetland to filter the ditch water, prior to its entry into Maumee Bay. As part of this study, we administered an on-site non-market valuation survey of beach visitors, in which observed and contingent trips to the beach were used to estimate the potential welfare benefits of the restored wetlands. The data were analyzed using three versions of the multivariate Poisson-lognormal (MPLN) model, a random effects count data model. We conclude version one, with flexible covariance structure and vehicle costs of \$0.25 per mile, is the preferred version and use it to estimate an average annual willingness to pay (WTP) of \$166 to construct wetlands and improve water quality. The aggregate annual benefit to an estimated 37,300 annual beach visitors is estimated as \$6.19 million. The robustness of this estimate to a variety of alternative assumptions is examined.},

	abstract = {Over the past two decades there has been a re-emergence of regular harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie due to increasing phosphorus loading, mainly from non-point agricultural sources. The Canadian and United States governments have jointly agreed to reduce phosphorus loadings to the lake in order to control the extent and severity of the blooms. Citizens on both sides of the border face a number of economic costs, both market and non-market, as a result of the blooms. This study values these costs for the Canadian portion of the Lake Erie basin economy using standard economic approaches that are widely applied within the world of cost-benefit analysis. The results suggest that algal blooms will impose equivalent annual costs equal to \$272 million in 2015 prices over a 30-year period if left unchecked. The largest market costs will be imposed on the tourism industry (\$110 million in equivalent annual costs) and the largest non-market costs will be borne by recreational users and those who place inherent value on the lake’s quality (\$115 million in equivalent annual costs). Management action to reduce phosphorus loadings is found to be justified on economic grounds if the 30-year net present value of the reduction program is less than \$1294 million (2015 Canadian dollars).},

Using a mail survey of 767 Ohio Lake Erie recreational angler respondents and a choice experiment, this study provides the first empirical quantification of the economic impacts of HABs on U.S. recreational anglers. Our results demonstrate a significant and substantial willingness to pay by anglers for reduction in HABs, beyond the benefits associated with conventional water quality measures such as catch rates and water clarity. For instance, we find that anglers are willing to pay \$8 to \$10 more per trip for one less mile of boating through HABs en route to a fishing site. This finding suggests that explicit measures of HABs need to be collected and considered when valuing water quality in nutrient-rich bodies of water. We evaluate the welfare improvements resulting from several nutrient reduction policies, and find that anglers are willing to pay on average \$40 to \$60 per trip for a policy that cuts upstream phosphorus loadings by 40\%. The majority of welfare gains for anglers result from improving the non-catchable component of the fishing experience, notably water clarity and HAB reduction, as opposed to better chances of angler success.},

	abstract = {Lake Erie () is the fourth largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America and the eleventh-largest globally. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point Lake Erie is 210 feet (64 m) deep.
Situated on the International Boundary between Canada and the United States, Lake Erie's northern shore is the Canadian province of Ontario, specifically the Ontario Peninsula, with the U.S. states of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its western, southern, and eastern shores. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake with water boundaries. The largest city on the lake is Cleveland, anchoring the third largest U.S. metro area in the Great Lakes region, after Greater Chicago and Metro Detroit. Other major cities along the lake shore include Buffalo, New York; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Toledo, Ohio.
Situated below Lake Huron, Erie's primary inlet is the Detroit River. The main natural outflow from the lake is via the Niagara River, which provides hydroelectric power to Canada and the U.S. as it spins huge turbines near Niagara Falls at Lewiston, New York and Queenston, Ontario. Some outflow occurs via the Welland Canal, part of the Saint Lawrence Seaway, which diverts water for ship passages from Port Colborne, Ontario on Lake Erie, to St. Catharines on Lake Ontario, an elevation difference of 326 ft (99 m). Lake Erie's environmental health has been an ongoing concern for decades, with issues such as overfishing, pollution, algae blooms, and eutrophication generating headlines.},

However, how do individuals value the environment? In this paper, we review the life satisfaction approach (LSA), which represents a new nonmarket valuation technique. The LSA builds on the recent development of subjective well-being research in economics and takes measures of reported life satisfaction as an empirical approximation to individual welfare. Microeconometric life satisfaction functions are estimated, taking into account environmental conditions along with income and other covariates. The estimated coefficients for the environmental good and income can then be used to calculate the implicit willingness to pay for the environmental good.},

We systematically reviewed evidence on the validity and reliability of environmental DCEs from the past thirteen years (Jan 2003–February 2016). 107 articles met our inclusion criteria. These studies provide limited and mixed evidence of the reliability and validity of DCE. Valuation results were susceptible to small changes in survey design in 45\% of outcomes reporting reliability measures. DCE results were generally consistent with those of other stated preference techniques (convergent validity), but hypothetical bias was common. Evidence supporting theoretical validity (consistency with assumptions of rational choice theory) was limited. In content validity tests, 2–90\% of respondents protested against a feature of the survey, and a considerable proportion found DCEs to be incomprehensible or inconsequential (17–40\% and 10–62\% respectively). DCE remains useful for non-market valuation, but its results should be used with caution. Given the sparse and inconclusive evidence base, we recommend that tests of reliability and validity are more routinely integrated into DCE studies and suggest how this might be achieved.},

This article set out to conduct a literature review, describe empirical applications within sports, and present a typology and conceptual discussion of valuation approaches.Research methods: A literature review, synthesis, and critical assessment of existing monetary valuation research in sports were performed.Results and findings: The review identified 113 articles which employed eight different valuation approaches. The contingent valuation method (CVM), hedonic pricing (HP), and the travel cost method (TCM) were the most frequently applied approaches. The most popular research contexts were professional team sports, sport tourism, and sport events. Valuation research was mainly conducted in the United States, Germany, and the UK. Altogether, 179 different scholars have contributed to this body of research, with 15 scholars having published at least three papers on this topic. The valuation approaches were assigned to three main categories: revealed preference approaches, including HP, opportunity cost approach (OCA), replacement cost approach (RCA), compensating variation approach (CVA), and TCM; stated preference approaches, including CVM, contingent behavior method (CBM), and choice modeling (CM); and hybrid approaches combining revealed and stated preference approaches.Implications: Future valuation research should exploit the advantages of hybrid approaches and provide comparisons of monetary values obtained by different valuation approaches.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial carbon storage is influenced by a number of environmental factors, among which topographic and geomorphological features are of special significance. This study was designed to examine the relationships of soil organic carbon (SOC) density to various terrain parameters and watershed characteristics across Louisiana, USA. A polygon data set of 484 watersheds and 12 river drainage basins for Louisiana was used to form the landscape units. SOC densities were calculated for each soil map unit using the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database. Average drainage densities and average slopes at watershed and basin scales were quantified with the 1:24 K Digital Elevation Models (DEM) data, and the Louisiana hydrographic water features. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to determine relationships among drainage density, slope, elevation, and SOC. The study found an average watershed drainage density of 1.6 km/km2 and an average watershed slope of 2.9 degrees in Louisiana. The results revealed that SOC density at both watershed and basin scales was closely related to drainage density, slope, and elevation. SOC density was positively correlated with watershed drainage density, but negatively correlated with watershed slope gradient and elevation. Regression models were developed for predicting SOC density at watershed and basin scales, obtaining regression coefficients (r2) ranging from 0.43 to 0.83. The study showed that estimation of SOC at watershed and drainage basin scales combining DEM data can be a feasible approach to improve the understanding of the relationships among SOC, topographic, and geomorphological features.},

	abstract = {Estimation of soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and fluxes bears large uncertainties because SOC stocks vary greatly over geographical space and through time. Although development of the U.S. Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), currently the most detailed level with a map scale ranging from 1:12 000 to 1:63 360, has involved substantial government funds and coordinated network efforts, very few studies have utilized it for soil carbon assessment at the large landscape scale. The objectives of this study were to 1) compare estimates in soil organic matter among SSURGO, the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO), and referenced field measurements at the soil map unit; 2) examine the influence of missing data on SOC estimation by SSURGO and STATSGO; 3) quantify spatial differences in SOC estimation between SSURGO and STATSGO, specifically for the state of Louisiana; and 4) assess scale effects on soil organic carbon density (SOCD) estimates from a soil map unit to a watershed and a river basin scale. SOC was estimated using soil attributes of SSURGO and STATSGO including soil organic matter (SOM) content, soil layer depth, and bulk density. Paired t-test, correlation, and regression analyses were performed to investigate various relations of SOC and SOM among the datasets. There were positive relations of SOC estimates between SSURGO and STATSGO at the soil map unit (R2 = 0.56, n = 86, t = 1.65, P = 0.102; depth: 30 cm). However, the SOC estimated by STATSGO were 9\%, 33\% and 36\% lower for the upper 30-cm, the upper 1-m, and the maximal depth (up to 2.75 m) soils, respectively, than those from SSURGO. The difference tended to increase as the spatial scale changes from the soil map unit to the watershed and river basin scales. Compared with the referenced field measurements, the estimates in SOM by SSURGO showed a closer match than those of STATSGO, indicating that the former was more accurate than the latter in SOC estimation, both in spatial and temporal resolutions. Further applications of SSURGO in SOC estimation for the entire United States could improve the accuracy of soil carbon accounting in regional and national carbon balances.},

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is the largest terrestrial carbon (C) sink on Earth; this pool plays a critical role in ecosystem processes and climate change. Given the cost and time required to measure SOC, and particularly changes in SOC, many signatory nations to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change report estimates of SOC stocks and stock changes using default values from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or country-specific models. In the United States, SOC in forests is monitored by the national forest inventory (NFI) conducted by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. The FIA program has been consistently measuring soil attributes as part of the NFI since 2001 and has amassed an extensive inventory of SOC in forest land in the conterminous United States and southeast and southcentral coastal Alaska. That said, the FIA program has been using country-specific predictions of SOC based, in part, upon a model using SOC estimates from the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) database compiled by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Estimates obtained from the STATSGO database are averages over large map units and are not expected to provide accurate estimates for specific locations, e.g., NFI plots. To improve the accuracy of SOC estimates in U.S. forests, NFI SOC observations were used for the first time to predict SOC density to a depth of 100 cm for all forested NFI plots. Incorporating soil-forming factors along with observations of SOC into a new estimation framework resulted in a 75\% (48 ± 0.78 Mg/ha) increase in SOC densities nationally. This substantially increases the contribution of the SOC pool, from approximately 44\% (17 Pg) of the total forest ecosystem C stocks to 56\% (28 Pg), in the forest C budget of the United States.},

	abstract = {The ‘4 per mille Soils for Food Security and Climate’ was launched at the COP21 with an aspiration to increase global soil organic matter stocks by 4 per 1000 (or 0.4 \%) per year as a compensation for the global emissions of greenhouse gases by anthropogenic sources. This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England \& Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30tCha−1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3GtCyear−1, which effectively offset 20–35\% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers.},

The results suggest that for \$100 per metric ton of carbon, 1.5 million metric tons of carbon could be sequestered per year on the 19.9 million hectares of cropland in the study region. These estimates suggest less carbon potential than existing studies because the opportunity costs associated with conservation tillage are fairly high. Annual carbon rental payments are found to be more efficient, as expected, but for smaller programs, per hectare rental payments are not substantially more costly.},

	abstract = {Recent research has shed light on the cost-effective contribution that agriculture can make to global greenhouse gas abatement; however, the resulting impacts on agricultural production, producer livelihoods, and food security remain largely unexplored. This paper provides an integrated assessment of the linkages between land-based climate policies, development, and food security, with a particular emphasis on abatement opportunities and impacts in the livestock sector. Targeting Annex I countries and exempting non-Annex I countries from land-based carbon policies on equity or food security grounds may result in significant leakage rates for livestock production and agriculture as a whole. We find that such leakage can be eliminated by supplying forest carbon sequestration incentives to non-Annex I countries. Furthermore, substantial additional global agricultural abatement can be attained by extending a greenhouse gas emissions tax to non-Annex I agricultural producers, while compensating them for their additional tax expenses. Because of their relatively large emissions intensities and limited abatement possibilities, ruminant meat producers face the greatest market adjustments to land-based climate policies. We also evaluate the impacts of climate policies on livelihoods and food consumption in developing countries. In the absence of non-Annex I abatement policies, these impacts are modest. However, strong income and food consumption impacts surface because of higher food costs after forest carbon sequestration is promoted at a global scale. Food consumption among unskilled labor households falls but rises for the representative farm households, because global agricultural supplies are restricted and farm prices rise sharply in the face of inelastic food demands.},

	abstract = {This study develops cumulative carbon ''supply curves'' for global forests utilizing a dynamic timber supply model for sequestration of forest carbon. Because the period of concern is the next century, and particular time points within that century, the curves are not traditional Marshallian supply curves or steady-state supply curves. Rather, the focus is on cumulative carbon cost curves (quasi-supply curves) at various points in time over the next 100 years. The research estimates a number of long-term, cumulative, carbon quasi-supply curves under different price scenarios and for different time periods. The curves trace out the relationship between an intertemporal price path for carbon, as given by carbon shadow prices, and the cumulative carbon sequestered from the initiation of the shadow prices, set at 2000, to a selected future year (2010, 2050, 2100). The timber supply model demonstrates that cumulative carbon quasi-supply curves that can be generated through forestry significantly depend on initial carbon prices and expectations regarding the time profile of future carbon prices. Furthermore, long-run quasi-supply curves generated from a constant price will have somewhat different characteristics from quasi-supply curves generated with an expectation of rising carbon prices through time.The ?least-cost? curves vary the time periods under consideration and the time profile of carbon prices. The quasi-supply curves suggest that a policy of gradually increasing carbon prices will generate the least costly supply curves in the shorter periods of a decade or so. Over longer periods of time, however, such as 50 or 100 years, these advantages appear to dissipate.},

The key driver of land-use change in the model is county-level measures of net returns to five major land uses. The net returns are modified for the IPCC scenarios according to assumed trends in population and income and projections from integrated assessment models of agricultural prices and agricultural and forestry yields. For both scenarios, we project large increases in urban land by the middle of the century, while the largest declines are in cropland area. Significant differences among regions in the projected patterns of land-use change are evident, including an expansion of forests in the Mountain and Plains regions with declines elsewhere. Comparisons to projections with no climate change effects on prices and yields reveal relatively small differences. Thus, our findings suggest that future land-use patterns in the U.S. will be shaped largely by urbanization, with climate change having a relatively small influence.},

A substantial part of the solution to the climate crisis may lie in growing crops for fuel and using trees for storing carbon. This book investigates the potential of these options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, estimates the costs to the economy, and analyses the trade-offs with growing food. The first part presents new databases that are necessary to underpin policy-relevant research in the field of climate change while describing and critically assessing the underlying data, the methodologies used, and the first applications.  Together, the new data and the extended models allow for a thorough and comprehensive analysis of a land use and climate policy. This book outlines key empirical and analytical issues associated with modelling land use and land use change in the context of global climate change policy. It places special emphasis on the economy-wide competition for land and other resources, especially;   The implications of changes in land use for the cost of climate change mitigation,    Land use change as a result of mitigation, and    Feedback from changes in the global climate to land use.  By offering synthesis and evaluation of a variety of different approaches to this challenging field of research, this book will serve as a key reference for future work in the economic analysis of land use and climate change policy.},

	abstract = {Land-based climate mitigation measures have gained significant attention and importance in public and private sector climate policies. Building on previous studies, we refine and update the mitigation potentials for 20 land-based measures in {\textgreater}200 countries and five regions, comparing “bottom-up” sectoral estimates with integrated assessment models (IAMs). We also assess implementation feasibility at the country level. Cost-effective (available up to \$100/tCO2eq) land-based mitigation is 8–13.8 GtCO2eq yr−1 between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the IAM median and the upper end representing the sectoral estimate. The cost-effective sectoral estimate is about 40\% of available technical potential and is in line with achieving a 1.5°C pathway in 2050. Compared to technical potentials, cost-effective estimates represent a more realistic and actionable target for policy. The cost-effective potential is approximately 50\% from forests and other ecosystems, 35\% from agriculture, and 15\% from demand-side measures. The potential varies sixfold across the five regions assessed (0.75–4.8 GtCO2eq yr−1) and the top 15 countries account for about 60\% of the global potential. Protection of forests and other ecosystems and demand-side measures present particularly high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs. The feasibility assessment suggests that governance, economic investment, and socio-cultural conditions influence the likelihood that land-based mitigation potentials are realized. A substantial portion of potential (80\%) is in developing countries and LDCs, where feasibility barriers are of greatest concern. Assisting countries to overcome barriers may result in significant quantities of near-term, low-cost mitigation while locally achieving important climate adaptation and development benefits. Opportunities among countries vary widely depending on types of land-based measures available, their potential co-benefits and risks, and their feasibility. Enhanced investments and country-specific plans that accommodate this complexity are urgently needed to realize the large global potential from improved land stewardship.},

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970–2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5–15\% (0.07–0.17 °C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were ≥ 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

This study evaluated SOC from three USDA soil databases for Maine, a state that is nearly 90\% forested. These databases were: (1) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), (2) NRCS Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO), and (3) Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA). We compared estimates of SOC density and concentration among databases and analyzed relationships between key soil properties and SOC densities and concentrations. Estimates of SOC density to a 20 cm depth which allows comparison among all three databases were 77 ± 1.2 Mg ha−1, 95 ± 0.3 Mg ha−1, and 39 ± 2.2 Mg ha−1 for SSURGO, RaCA, and FIA, respectively. Significant differences existed among databases in SOC density at shallow depth increments, and marked differences existed among databases in the soil depths measured. Analysis of the influence of soil texture and drainage class on SOC highlighted the importance of silt and clay in SOC retention. A hypothetical increase in forest and agricultural SOC was compared to reported Maine GHG emissions to illustrate potential policy implications in the use of soil databases. We conclude that all three databases are valuable but not interchangeable. The database should be carefully chosen to match the objectives of the user.},

	abstract = {Previous assessments of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have used soil maps and other tacit knowledge from soil survey to aggregate and extrapolate data without assessing the relationship between SOC and the tacit information used. The objective of this paper is to outline a process that translates tacit class-based knowledge into semiquantitative information about SOC stocks. This information was used to create a soil-based strata for sample selection to inventory SOC stocks. The process was completed in three steps: (i) official series descriptions (OSDs) were used to compile comprehensive soil information, (ii) an ordinal scoring system was developed and applied to link soil properties to likely SOC stocks, and (iii) hierarchical clustering was applied to cluster soils into groups for sampling. The scores and groups were tested using pedon SOC stocks from the National Cooperative Soil Survey laboratory database. Expert soil scientists interpreted individual terms used in Soil Taxonomy and OSDs for their explicit or implicit relationships with SOC stocks. Taxa, soil moisture regime, and temperature regime were separated as individual factors. Other information from the OSDs including family particle size class, depth to restrictive layer, and drainage class were used to translate qualitative information into ordinal scores. Classes for taxonomic order, soil moisture regimes, and drainage class were significantly different in pedon SOC stocks across and within regions. Scores within each factor (taxonomy, moisture regime, drainage class, temperature regime, and soil depth) were also significantly different from one another in pedon SOC stocks. Ordinal scores were used to cluster soils within each of 17 regions. Soil groups were significantly different from one another in SOC stocks in each of the 17 sampling regions. The process was considered satisfactory and was used to stratify soils for SOC stock sampling in the conterminous United States. A similar process could be applied to any soil property over any area of interest to evaluate tacit knowledge for communicating soil information, grouping soils for interpretation, or creating strata for distributing samples.},

	abstract = {Soil bulk density (ρb) is important because of its direct effect on soil properties (e.g., porosity, soil moisture availability) and crop yield. Additionally, ρb measurements are needed to express soil organic carbon (SOC) and other nutrient stocks on an area basis (kgha−1). However, ρb measurements are commonly missing from databases for reasons that include omission due to sampling constraints and laboratory mishandling. The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of novel pedotransfer functions (PTFs) in predicting ρb as a function of textural class and basic pedon description information extracted from the horizon of interest (the horizon for which ρb is being predicted), and ρb, textural class, and basic pedon description information extracted from horizons above or below and directly adjacent or not adjacent to the horizon of interest. A total of 2,680 pedons (20,045 horizons) were gathered from the USDA-NRCS National Soil Survey Center characterization database. Twelve ρb PTFs were developed by combining PTF types, database configurations, and horizon limiting depths. Different PTF types were created considering the direction of prediction in the soil profile: upward and downward prediction models. Multiple database configurations were used to mimic different scenarios of horizons missing ρb values: random missing (e.g., ρb sample lost in transit) and patterned or systematic missing (e.g., no ρb samples collected for horizons{\textgreater}30cm depth). For each database configuration scenario, upward and downward models were developed separately. Three limiting depths (20, 30, and 50cm) were tested to identify any threshold depth between upward and downward models. For both PTF types, validation results indicated that models derived from the database configuration mimicking random horizons missing ρb performed better than those derived from the configuration mimicking clear patterns of missing ρb measurements. All 12 PTFs performed well (RMSPE: 0.10–0.15gcm−3). The threshold depth of 50cm most successfully split the database between upward and downward models. For all PTFs, the ρb of other horizons in the soil profile was the most important variable in predicting ρb. The proposed PTFs provide reasonably accurate ρb predictions, and have the potential to help researchers and other users to fill gaps in their database without complicated data acquisition.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.agee.2014.10.024},
	abstract = {A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields, like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated with SOC stock change (R2=0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32±0.08Mgha−1yr−1 in a mean soil depth of 22cm and during the observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock accumulation of 16.7±1.5Mgha−1 for a soil depth of 22cm. Thus, the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC sequestration of 0.12±0.03PgCyr−1, which would compensate for 8\% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable greenhouse gas budgets.},

We compared local models with the global models and PLSR versus ANN. ANN models outperform PLSR in global models, but local models improve substantially in PLSR. Overall, local PLSR models developed from Horizon and Texture are most favorable Visible and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VisNIR) has been used across a number of spatial scales to predict soil organic carbon (OC) content. The Rapid Carbon Assessment Project (RaCA) is a nationwide project that collected 144,000+ soil samples from across the conterminous United States for C stock mapping using VisNIR. The objective of this study was to calibrate and validate the VisNIR soil OC and total C (TC) models with ∼20,000 samples from RaCA. Models were developed with either partial least squares regression (PLSR) or the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Four auxiliary variables—RaCA Region, Land Use Land Cover, Master Horizon, and Textural Class—were tested to stratify the dataset and to develop local models. The results showed that OC and TC models calibrated with ANN (R2 {\textgreater} 0.94; RPD {\textgreater} 4.0) outperformed those of PLSR (R2 = 0.83; RPD = 2.4). For PLSR, local models developed with all four auxiliary variables exhibited improvement in prediction accuracy, and the improvement was only marginal for ANN models. Master Horizon and Textural Class appeared to be more effective in stratifying samples into homogeneous groups because they gave an overall lower root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for the validation samples. For the majority of the local Textural Class models, the RMSEP of OC prediction ranged from 0.5 to 1.5\%. To maximize the applicability of the RaCA spectral library on external soil samples, PLSR local models developed from Master Horizon or Textural Class appeared to be more favorable.},

	abstract = {In 2011, Lake Erie experienced the largest harmful algal bloom in its recorded history, with a peak intensity over three times greater than any previously observed bloom. Here we show that long-term trends in agricultural practices are consistent with increasing phosphorus loading to the western basin of the lake, and that these trends, coupled with meteorological conditions in spring 2011, produced record-breaking nutrient loads. An extended period of weak lake circulation then led to abnormally long residence times that incubated the bloom, and warm and quiescent conditions after bloom onset allowed algae to remain near the top of the water column and prevented flushing of nutrients from the system. We further find that all of these factors are consistent with expected future conditions. If a scientifically guided management plan to mitigate these impacts is not implemented, we can therefore expect this bloom to be a harbinger of future blooms in Lake Erie.},

The PYTPAQ was completed twice at baseline, 9 weeks apart (on average), by 154 healthy Canadian men and women aged 35–65 years for assessment of reliability. The PYTPAQ was completed again 1 year later as a self-administered questionnaire. Four times during the year, participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days and completed 7-day physical activity logs. The authors assessed validity by comparing PYTPAQ summary values with 1-year averages of the physical activity logs and accelerometer data and with physical fitness and anthropometric data measured at baseline and 1 year. Spearman correlations for reliability (metabolic equivalent-hours/week) were 0.64 for total activity, 0.70 for occupational activity, 0.73 for recreational activity, and 0.65 for household activity. For total activity, the intraclass correlation coefficient for correlation between the PYTPAQ and the 7-day physical activity logs was 0.42 (95\% confidence interval: 0.28, 0.54), and for the accelerometer data it was 0.18 (95\% confidence interval: 0.03, 0.32). Spearman correlations between PYTPAQ hours/week of vigorous activity and maximal oxygen uptake were 0.37 and 0.32 at baseline and follow-up, respectively. In general, the PYTPAQ has acceptable reliability and validity for measurement of past-year physical activity that is comparable to that of similar questionnaires.},

	abstract = {Travel cost recreation demand models stem from a simple, but penetrating, insight. Consumption of an outdoor recreation site's services requires the user to incur the costs of a trip to that site. Travel costs serve as implicit prices. These costs reflect both people's distances from recreation sites visited and their specific opportunity costs of time. Today, economic analyses of recreation choices are among the most advanced examples of microeconometric modeling of consumer behavior in economics. The primary focus of this chapter is on the methods used to describe individuals' recreation choices. We are interested in the economic assumptions made in descriptions of behavior and measures of the economic value of amenities. Before developing this summary, in Section 2 we discuss how outdoor recreation fits within consumers' overall expenditures. Section 3 describes how we might ideally like to estimate consumers' preferences for recreation resources and the compromises implied by the models currently being used. Econometric details are deferred until Section 5, after a discussion of the features of recreation data in Section 4. In Section 6 we turn to conceptual issues in welfare measurement. We close in Section 7 with a discussion of a few research opportunities that seem especially important for the future.},

	abstract = {Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (cHABs) have significant socioeconomic and ecological costs, which impact drinking water, fisheries, agriculture, tourism, real estate, water quality, food web resilience and habitats, and contribute to anoxia and fish kills. Many of these costs are well described, but in fact are largely unmeasured. Worldwide cHABs can produce toxins (cyanotoxins), which cause acute or chronic health effects in mammals (including humans) and other organisms. There are few attempts to characterize the full health-related effects other than acute incidences, which may go unrecorded. At present these are difficult to access and evaluate and may be ascribed to other causes. Such information is fundamental to measure the full costs of cHABs and inform the need for often-costly management and remediation. This paper synthesizes information on cHABs occurrence, toxicology and health effects, and relates this to past and current conditions in the Great Lakes, a major global resource which supplies 84\% of the surface water in North America. This geographic region has seen a significant resurgence of cHABs since the 1980s. In particular we focus on Lake Erie, where increased reporting of cHABs has occurred from the early 1990's. We evaluate available information and case reports of cHAB-related illness and death and show that cHABs occur throughout the basin, with reports of animal illness and death, especially dogs and livestock. Lake Erie has consistently experienced cHABs and cyanotoxins in the last decade with probable cases of human illness, while the other Great Lakes show intermittent cHABs and toxins, but no confirmed reports on illness or toxicity. The dominant toxigenic cyanobacterium is the genus Microcystis known to produce microcystins. The presence of other cyanotoxins (anatoxin-a, paralytic shellfish toxins) implicates other toxigenic cyanobacteria such as Anabaena (Dolichospermum) and Lyngbya.},

	abstract = {This paper uses a novel combination of revealed preference data from site intercepts and stated preference data from online surveys to estimate the welfare impacts of different fire scenarios at recreation sites within the Angeles National Forest. In 2016, we collected onsite visitation data at random times and locations from among 32 sites in the Angeles National Forest. The on-site visitation data includes on-site counts and short intercept interviews of 2,266 visitors. In a follow up survey, we collect contingent behavior data. Under eight different fire history scenarios which corresponded to the vegetation at the site they visited, respondents were asked contingent behavior questions to ascertain if they would still make the same trip as before. Our empirical strategy exploits both the onsite and contingent behavior data to estimate welfare effects of fires. The sampling design weights and site counts allow us to estimate total visits to each site as well as the number of visits a site receives from each origin zip code. With the zonal visitation data, we estimate a multi-site zonal travel cost model with a full set of alternative specific constants following the approach developed by von Haefen et al. for the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This model provides estimates of visitation to each site under unchanged conditions which are then calibrated via contraction maps to estimates of the percentage of visitors who would have still visited the site at which they were intercepted under alternate fire history scenarios. Our RP/SP estimation procedure allows us to value both site closures and the impacts of fire history on sites after they reopen. Results contribute to forest management when facing increasing threats of site closures by providing insight into potential impacts during and after closures in a popular urban national forest.},

	abstract = {The management of natural resources may potentially be improved when governance structures in social-ecological systems enable coordination among multiple actors who may operate on the same or different geographic and/or governmental scales. In this article, we analyze the network of formal coordination ties that link governmental and nongovernmental actors in the Maumee River watershed, which is the largest source of phosphorus loading into Lake Erie, one of the five Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has seen a return of the seasonal harmful algal blooms (HAB) that were common in the 1960s and 1970s, and considerable research suggests that they might be triggered by excessive amounts of phosphorus produced by agriculture. Analyzing an assortment of documents that collectively detail how stakeholders relate to each other on the topic of nutrient management in the watershed, we examine who are the actors that are more likely to fulfill coordination roles, and the scales at which coordination takes place (vertically vs horizontally). Results suggest that coordination has been formalized vertically, with actors who operate at higher governmental levels being more likely to coordinate the activities of actors at lower levels. In addition, we see evidence of horizontal coordination but only in the confines of the individual state jurisdictions that share the watershed. We see this as a potentially important obstacle to solving the HABs problem in Lake Erie, given that the management of interjurisdictional watersheds is likely to be ineffective in the absence of proper coordination across the different jurisdictions that share the watershed.},

HAB toxins cause a substantial but unquantified amount of human and animal morbidity and mortality from exposures in recreational, commercial, drinking-source and potable waters. HAB biomass and toxins threaten the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. U.S. Congressional legislation mandated the establishment of a National Research Plan for Coastal Harmful Algal Blooms, but no similar plan exists for freshwater HABs (FHABs). Eutrophication and FHABs are conservatively estimated to cost the U.S. economy 2.2–4.6 billion dollars annually. A National Research Plan for Freshwater Harmful Algal Blooms is needed to develop U.S. policy and regulations or guidelines to confront FHAB risks. This report reviews the state of FHAB occurrence, risk and risk management assessments in the U.S. Research is identified that must be accomplished to characterize occurrence and risks, and develop cost effective strategies for preventing, suppressing and mitigating FHABs. U.S. Congressional legislation is needed to mandate a National Research Plan for FHABs, establish a timeline for developing policy and fund competitive research-grant programs. The research results will provide a sound scientific basis for making policy determinations and implementing risk management strategies. Successfully confronting FHAB risks will strengthen the U.S. economy, protect human and animal health and help ensure the sustainability of our Nation's freshwater bodies.},

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are diverse phenomena involving multiple. species and classes of algae that occupy a broad range of habitats from lakes to oceans and produce a multiplicity of toxins or bioactive compounds that impact many different resources. Here, a review of the status of this complex array of marine HAB problems in the U.S. is presented, providing historical information and trends as well as future perspectives. The study relies on thirty years (1990–2019) of data in HAEDAT - the IOC-ICES-PICES Harmful Algal Event database, but also includes many other reports. At a qualitative level, the U.S. national HAB problem is far more extensive than was the case decades ago, with more toxic species and toxins to monitor, as well as a larger range of impacted resources and areas affected. Quantitatively, no significant trend is seen for paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) events over the study interval, though there is clear evidence of the expansion of the problem into new regions and the emergence of a species that produces PSTs in Florida – Pyrodinium bahamense. Amnesic shellfish toxin (AST) events have significantly increased in the U.S., with an overall pattern of frequent outbreaks on the West Coast, emerging, recurring outbreaks on the East Coast, and sporadic incidents in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the long historical record of neurotoxic shellfish toxin (NST) events, no significant trend is observed over the past 30 years. The recent emergence of diarrhetic shellfish toxins (DSTs) in the U.S. began along the Gulf Coast in 2008 and expanded to the West and East Coasts, though no significant trend through time is seen since then. Ciguatoxin (CTX) events caused by Gambierdiscus dinoflagellates have long impacted tropical and subtropical locations in the U.S., but due to a lack of monitoring programs as well as under-reporting of illnesses, data on these events are not available for time series analysis. Geographic expansion of Gambierdiscus into temperate and non-endemic areas (e.g., northern Gulf of Mexico) is apparent, and fostered by ocean warming. HAB-related marine wildlife morbidity and mortality events appear to be increasing, with statistically significant increasing trends observed in marine mammal poisonings caused by ASTs along the coast of California and NSTs in Florida. Since their first occurrence in 1985 in New York, brown tides resulting from high-density blooms of Aureococcus have spread south to Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, while those caused by Aureoumbra have spread from the Gulf Coast to the east coast of Florida. Blooms of Margalefidinium polykrikoides occurred in four locations in the U.S. from 1921–2001 but have appeared in more than 15  U.S. estuaries since then, with ocean warming implicated as a causative factor. Numerous blooms of toxic cyanobacteria have been documented in all 50  U.S. states and the transport of cyanotoxins from freshwater systems into marine coastal waters is a recently identified and potentially significant threat to public and ecosystem health. Taken together, there is a significant increasing trend in all HAB events in HAEDAT over the 30-year study interval. Part of this observed HAB expansion simply reflects a better realization of the true or historic scale of the problem, long obscured by inadequate monitoring. Other contributing factors include the dispersion of species to new areas, the discovery of new HAB poisoning syndromes or impacts, and the stimulatory effects of human activities like nutrient pollution, aquaculture expansion, and ocean warming, among others. One result of this multifaceted expansion is that many regions of the U.S. now face a daunting diversity of species and toxins, representing a significant and growing challenge to resource managers and public health officials in terms of toxins, regions, and time intervals to monitor, and necessitating new approaches to monitoring and management. Mobilization of funding and resources for research, monitoring and management of HABs requires accurate information on the scale and nature of the national problem. HAEDAT and other databases can be of great value in this regard but efforts are needed to expand and sustain the collection of data regionally and nationally.},

To update information from our 2006 survey, we conducted a mail survey of 500 randomly selected Ohio charter boat captains in early 2010 and received usable information from 239 captains. In 2010 the Ohio Department of Natural Resources licensed 786 charter guides compared to 783 licensed captains in 2006. Possibly reflecting difficult economic times, charter firms in 2010 made on average 10.1 fewer trips per firm (34.6) than in 2006 (44.7). These captains made an estimated 21,082 charter trips in 2010, of which over 81\% were full-day and almost 19\% were half-day trips. Mean total revenues earned in 2010 (\$15,132 ± \$16,110) declined over 13\% from 2006. Declining harvests, invasive species, and increasing operating costs highlight the concerns noted by captains responding to the survey. Policies and actions to address declining sport fish populations, invasive species, and other key issues may have positive impacts on the industry and help it continue into the future.},

Water quality measures are linked to the choice set via the use of EPA's Index of Watershed Index database.

Since the command nlogit of Stata 7.0 implements the other variant (called non-normalized nested logit, NNNL), an implementation of RUMNL called nlogitrum is introduced. Numerous examples support and illustrate the differences between both specifications.},

	abstract = {In the wake of a massive offshore oil spill, federal and state agencies undertook studies to determine the reduction in outdoor recreational trips along the Gulf of Mexico. This paper describes three of those efforts, which gauged the impact of the oil spill on beach visits, boating, and fishing. Together the studies represented an enormous undertaking, involving nearly half a million aerial photographs, 35,000 onsite counts, and 129,000 interviews over a period of three years. For each activity, samples of time-place combinations were quickly developed and systematic data collection covering hundreds of miles of the most affected areas began within six weeks of the start of the spill and soon expanded to cover more than 1,000 miles of shoreline. The research used a mix of aerial and onsite counts and interview data to estimate the reduction in recreation due to the spill. “Baseline” estimates were developed that represented what the level of recreation would have been in the absence of the spill. These estimates were derived from the observed levels of recreation at a later period when the spill was unlikely to have had continuing effects on recreation, with adjustments for differences in the weather between the baseline period and the period immediately after the spill. Overall, the results suggest that there were about 12.3 million fewer visits to the beach because of the spill. In addition, 215,000 fewer boaters went out in the Gulf and anglers made 144,000 fewer fishing trips. We conclude with a discussion of the lessons learned from the study.},

In this paper we develop a series of random utility models of site choice by saltwater anglers in the Southeast US and estimate monetary compensation for recreational losses due to the DWH oil spill. Heterogeneity in angler preferences is accounted for by using mixed logit models, and different compensation measures for shore-based, private boat, and for-hire anglers are estimated. Results indicate that willingness to pay for oil spill prevention varies by fishing mode and anglers fishing from shore and private boats exhibit heterogeneous preferences for oil spill avoidance. In addition, the total monetary compensation due to anglers is estimated at USD 585 million.},

We developed a recreation demand model to monetize economic damages associated with lost shoreline recreational user days attributable to the spill. The unprecedented magnitude of the spill disruption led to a variety of innovations. We estimate a model of shoreline recreation trips to the Gulf Coast region from the general population of the contiguous U.S., combining single and multiple-day trips, calculating travel costs that incorporate detailed information on flying costs and transportation mode choice, and using alternative-specific constants to control for site characteristics. Losses per recreational user day are assessed using utility adjustments that reproduce the decline in recreation observed through onsite counts. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate our lost user day value is robust to changes in income imputation, nesting structure, site aggregation and spill calibration, and show the importance of accounting for flying as a mode choice. Estimated losses from the primary shoreline study are \$520 million (±166) out of the total recreational damages of \$661 million (2015\$).},

Small changes in the soil organic carbon stock could result in significant impacts on the atmospheric carbon concentration. The fluxes of soil organic carbon vary in response to a host of potential environmental and anthropogenic driving factors. Scientists worldwide are contemplating questions such as: ‘What is the average net change in soil organic carbon due to environmental conditions or management practices?’, ‘How can soil organic carbon sequestration be enhanced to achieve some mitigation of atmospheric carbon dioxide?’ and ‘Will this secure soil quality?’. These questions are far reaching, because maintaining and improving the world's soil resource is imperative to providing sufficient food and fibre to a growing population. Additional challenges are expected through climate change and its potential to increase food shortages. This review highlights knowledge of the amount of carbon stored in soils globally, and the potential for carbon sequestration in soil. It also discusses successful methods and models used to determine and estimate carbon pools and fluxes. This knowledge and technology underpins decisions to protect the soil resource.},

This paper reviews the literature for the influence of land use changes on soil C stocks and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data from 74 publications. The meta analysis indicates that soil C stocks decline after land use changes from pasture to plantation (−10\%), native forest to plantation (−13\%), native forest to crop (−42\%), and pasture to crop (−59\%). Soil C stocks increase after land use changes from native forest to pasture (+ 8\%), crop to pasture (+ 19\%), crop to plantation (+ 18\%), and crop to secondary forest (+ 53\%). Wherever one of the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil carbon and vice versa. As the quantity of available data is not large and the methodologies used are diverse, the conclusions drawn must be regarded as working hypotheses from which to design future targeted investigations that broaden the database. Within some land use changes there were, however, sufficient examples to explore the role of other factors contributing to the above conclusions. One outcome of the meta analysis, especially worthy of further investigation in the context of carbon sink strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation, is that broadleaf tree plantations placed onto prior native forest or pastures did not affect soil C stocks whereas pine plantations reduced soil C stocks by 12–15\%.},

It uses a monthly time step to calculate total organic carbon (t C ha-1), microbial biomass carbon (t C ha-1) and Δ14C (from which the radiocarbon age of the soil can be calculated) on a years-to-centuries timescale (Jenkinson, 1990; Jenkinson and Coleman, 1994; Jenkinson et al., 1987; Jenkinson et al., 1991; Jenkinson et al., 1992). It needs few inputs and those it needs are easily obtainable. It is an extension of the earlier model described by Jenkinson and Rayner (1977), and by Hart (1984). Needless to say, it has many ideas in common with other contemporary turnover models, notably CENTURY (Parton et al., 1988) and Van Veen and Paul’s model (Van Veen and Paul, 1981).},

	abstract = {When agricultural land is no longer used for cultivation and allowed to revert to natural vegetation or replanted to perennial vegetation, soil organic carbon can accumulate. This accumulation process essentially reverses some of the effects responsible for soil organic carbon losses from when the land was converted from perennial vegetation. We discuss the essential elements of what is known about soil organic matter dynamics that may result in enhanced soil carbon sequestration with changes in land-use and soil management. We review literature that reports changes in soil organic carbon after changes in land-use that favour carbon accumulation. This data summary provides a guide to approximate rates of SOC sequestration that are possible with management, and indicates the relative importance of some factors that influence the rates of organic carbon sequestration in soil. There is a large variation in the length of time for and the rate at which carbon may accumulate in soil, related to the productivity of the recovering vegetation, physical and biological conditions in the soil, and the past history of soil organic carbon inputs and physical disturbance. Maximum rates of C accumulation during the early aggrading stage of perennial vegetation growth, while substantial, are usually much less than 100 g C m−2 y−1. Average rates of accumulation are similar for forest or grassland establishment: 33.8 g C m−2 y−1 and 33.2 g C m−2 y−1, respectively. These observed rates of soil organic C accumulation, when combined with the small amount of land area involved, are insufficient to account for a significant fraction of the missing C in the global carbon cycle as accumulating in the soils of formerly agricultural land.},

This paper illustrates the dynamics of SOC on the island of Java, Indonesia, from 1930 to 2010. We used 2002 soil profile observations containing organic carbon (C) analysis in the topsoil, which were collected by the Indonesian Center for Agricultural Land Resources Research \& Development from 1923 to 2007. Results show the obvious decline of SOC values from around 2\% in 1930–1940 to 0.8\% in 1960–1970. However, there has been an increase of SOC content since 1970, with a median level of 1.1\% in the year 2000. Our analysis suggests that the human influence and agricultural practices on SOC in Java have been a stronger influence than the environmental factors. SOC for the top 10 cm has shown a net accumulation rate of 0.2–0.3 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 during the period 1990–2000. These findings give rise to optimism for increased soil C sequestration in the tropics.},

	abstract = {Soil microorganisms have numerous functional roles in forest ecosystems, including: serving as sources and sinks of key nutrients and catalysts of nutrient transformations; acting as engineers and maintainers of soil structure; and forming mutualistic relationships with roots that improve plant fitness. Although both prescribed and wildland fires are common in temperate forests of North America, few studies have addressed the long-term influence of such disturbances on the soil microflora in these ecosystems. Fire alters the soil microbial community structure in the short-term primarily through heat-induced microbial mortality. Over the long-term, fire may modify soil communities by altering plant community composition via plant-induced changes in the soil environment. In this review, we summarize and synthesize the various studies that have assessed the effects of fire on forest soil microorganisms, emphasizing the mechanisms by which fire impacts these vital ecosystem engineers. The examples used in this paper are derived primarily from studies of ponderosa pine-dominated forests of the Inland West of the USA; these forests have some of the shortest historical fire-return intervals of any forest type, and thus the evolutionary role of fire in shaping these forests is likely the strongest. We argue that the short-term effects of fire on soil microflora and the processes they catalyze are transient, and suggest that more research be devoted to linking long-term plant community responses with those of the mutually dependent soil microflora.},

	abstract = {Process-based model analyses are often used to estimate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), particularly at regional to continental scales. However, uncertainties are rarely evaluated, and so it is difficult to determine how much confidence can be placed in the results. Our objective was to quantify uncertainties across multiple scales in a process-based model analysis, and provide 95\% confidence intervals for the estimates. Specifically, we used the Century ecosystem model to estimate changes in SOC stocks for US croplands during the 1990s, addressing uncertainties in model inputs, structure and scaling of results from point locations to regions and the entire country. Overall, SOC stocks increased in US croplands by 14.6 Tg C yr−1 from 1990 to 1995 and 17.5 Tg C yr−1 during 1995 to 2000, and uncertainties were ±22\% and ±16\% for the two time periods, respectively. Uncertainties were inversely related to spatial scale, with median uncertainties at the regional scale estimated at ±118\% and ±114\% during the early and latter part of 1990s, and even higher at the site scale with estimates at ±739\% and ±674\% for the time periods, respectively. This relationship appeared to be driven by the amount of the SOC stock change; changes in stocks that exceeded 200 Gg C yr−1 represented a threshold where uncertainties were always lower than ±100\%. Consequently, the amount of uncertainty in estimates derived from process-based models will partly depend on the level of SOC accumulation or loss. In general, the majority of uncertainty was associated with model structure in this application, and so attaining higher levels of precision in the estimates will largely depend on improving the model algorithms and parameterization, as well as increasing the number of measurement sites used to evaluate the structural uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Uncertainties in soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are rarely quantified even though they are critical in determining the significance of the results. Previous studies on this topic generally focused on a single variable involved in the SOC stock calculation (SOC concentration, sampling depth, bulk density and rock fragment content) or on a single scale, rather than using an integrated approach (i.e. taking into account interactions between variables). This study aims to apply such an approach to identify and quantify the uncertainties in SOC stock assessments for different scales and spatial landscape units (LSU) under agriculture. The error propagation method (δ method) was used to quantify the relative contribution of each variable and interaction involved to the final SOC stock variability. Monte Carlo simulations were used to cross-check the results. Both methods converged (r2=0.78). As expected, the coefficient of variation of the SOC stock increased across scales (from 5 to 35\%), and was higher for grassland than for cropland. Although the main source of uncertainty in the SOC stock varied according to the scale and the LSU considered, the variability of SOC concentration (due to errors from the laboratory and to the high SOC spatial variability) and of the rock fragment content were predominant. When assessing SOC stock at the landscape scale, one should focus on the precision of SOC analyses from the laboratory, the reduction of SOC spatial variability (using bulk samples, accurate re-sampling, high sampling density or stratified sampling), and the use of equivalent masses for SOC stock comparison. The regional SOC stock monitoring of agricultural soils in southern Belgium allows the detection of an average SOC stock change of 20\% within 11 years if very high rates of SOC stock changes occur (1 t C ha–1 year–1). Amplitude et sources des incertitudes liées aux estimations des stocks de carbone organique dans le sol (COS) à différentes échelles Résumé Les erreurs associées aux estimations du stock de carbone organique dans le sol (COS) sont rarement quantifiées bien qu’elles puissent empêcher l’obtention de résultats significatifs. Les quelques études qui le font focalisent en général sur une seule variable nécessaire au calcul du stock de COS (concentration en COS, profondeur échantillonnée, densité apparente et contenu en fragments rocheux) ou sur une échelle spatiale particulière, sans utiliser d’approche intégrée (prenant en compte les interactions entre les variables). Cette étude a pour objectif d’utiliser une telle approche pour identifier et quantifier les incertitudes liées aux estimations de stock de COS à différentes échelles spatiales et pour diverses unités spatiales de paysages (USP) agricoles. La loi de propagation des erreurs (méthode δ) permet de quantifier la contribution relative de chaque variable et interaction à la variabilité finale du stock de COS. Les simulations de Monte Carlo sont utilisées pour la vérification croisée des résultats. Les deux méthodes ont convergé (r2= 0.78). Comme prévu, le coefficient de variation du stock de COS a proportionnellement augmenté avec l’échelle spatiale considérée (de 5 à 35\%), et était plus élevé pour les cultures que pour les prairies. Bien que la principale source d’erreur sur le stock de COS soit fonction de l’échelle spatiale et du type d’USP considérés, la variabilité du contenu en COS (du fait des erreurs de laboratoire et de sa grande variabilité spatiale) et du contenu en fragments rocheux étaient prédominants. Lors de l’estimation des stocks de COS à l’échelle du paysage, l’attention devrait prioritairement porter sur la précision des analyses en COS du laboratoire, la réduction de la variabilité spatiale du COS (en utilisant des échantillons composites, un ré-échantillonnage précis, une densité d’échantillonnage élevée ou un échantillonnage stratifié), et sur l’utilisation de masses équivalentes pour comparer les stocks de COS. Le réseau régional de suivi des stocks de COS des sols agricoles dans le sud de la Belgique permet la détection d’un changement de stock de COS moyen de 20\% en 11 ans pour un taux très élevé de changement en stock de COS (1 t C ha–1 year–1).},

	abstract = {Urban areas are major producers of atmospheric CO2 emissions, but at the same time they can offset some of the associated C losses by retaining stable organic carbon in their soils (SOC). Despite the importance of urban SOC there are still many uncertainties associated, resulting in low accuracy of SOC stock estimations or in its neglection in the regional and national carbon budgets. We focused on one of the most extended urban areas of Italy (Milan) estimating SOC stock in the topsoil and comparing it for different urban land uses (park/non-park) and covers (woodland/grassland). We also compared urban SOC stocks with other typologies of natural and semi-natural land use in the region. We found generally high variability in urban soil properties. Average SOC of urban parks was higher (7.9 ± 2.4 kg m−2) than urban non-parks (5.3 ± 2.5 kg m−2); while SOC stock did not significantly differ for urban land cover types. Urban parks had SOC stock values comparable with forest, pasture and grasslands of the same region and higher than SOC of croplands. At the same time, urban non-parks had the lower SOC stocks values found in the region. The results highlighted the significant contribution of urban SOC stock to carbon budget estimations and differences based on urban land use types. Furthermore, we described the main pedological characteristics of investigated urban soils and we identified the factors that contribute to limiting our capacity to model urban SOC stock that can be partially overcome by the addressed strategies.},

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock is one of the most important carbon (C) reservoirs on the Earth and plays a vital role in the global climate change. However, SOC stock at a regional scale is still uncertain due to the lack of soil bulk density data, differences in sample depth, geography, and soil properties. Based on data from 78 soil profiles, we estimated SOC density (SOCD) and its distribution at 0–100 cm depth of croplands in three typical Counties (Lindian, Hailun and Baoqing Counties) in Northeast China. Soil organic carbon content and variations significantly decreased with increased soil depth. The SOCD in 100-cm depth ranged from 52.3 to 323.1 Mg ha−1, with an average of 163.6 Mg ha−1. The SOCD in the top 20 cm accounted for 32.8\% of that in 100 cm soil profile. A good mathematical equation between SOCD of 0–20 cm and 0–100 cm would be a useful tool to estimate SOCD in soil profiles. In addition, soil depth, bulk density, soil pH, and elevation were significantly correlated with SOC content. Regression of SOC in the data set to individual factors (soil depth, BD, soil pH, clay content, and elevation) is relevant to understand how C changes over time and depth.},

The distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the landscape is governed by multiple factors and processes occurring at multiple scales. Thus, an understanding of landscape processes and pedology should aid in designing approaches to study SOC stock changes. Numerous factors affect distribution of SOC in the landscape at varying spatial and temporal scales. Each of these is summarized to set the stage for outlining a proposed approach to monitoring SOC in the agricultural landscape. Many tools are used to assess the variability of soil properties at varying spatial scales. Pedological knowledge and interpretation of landscape processes can be used to understand the spatial distribution of SOC in the landscape. I show that semi-variograms and the minimum detectable difference may be of limited value in deriving a universal approach to assess SOC change. Issues to be considered or resolved before initiating a monitoring system include depth of sampling and influence of management, compositing and sub-sampling, changes in bulk density, landscape effects and SOC dynamics. After considering these issues, I propose an approach to monitor SOC stock change in agroecosystems, acknowledging that any methodology likely cannot be strictly and universally applicable. The approach considers issues such as location, plot layout, and experimental and statistical design. Such an approach, derived from a landscape and pedology perspective, may make the measurement and verification of SOC at varying scales a less daunting task.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty exists concerning the impact of cover crops with conservation tillage on the total agricultural environment. A study conducted from 2002 to 2005 by USDA-ARS and the Univ. of GA assessed the effects of cover crops on soil physical properties and C/N relationships in a sandy coastal plain soil. The cropping systems were (A) sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), sweet corn (Zea mays L.); (B) sunn hemp, fallow, sweet corn; (C) fallow, crimson clover, sweet corn; (D) fallow, fallow, sweet corn; or (E) fallow, fallow, fallow. Three N rates (0, 67, or 133kgha−1) were tested on the corn for cropping systems A, B, and C, while N rates of 0, 67, 133, 200, and 267kgha−1 were used for cropping system D. No N was applied to cropping system E. Soil physical property measurements made on minimally disturbed cores (7.6cm height×7.6cm diameter) collected from the top 7.6cm both within the row and interrow of each plot seven times during the study included bulk density (BD), saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and volumetric soil moisture content (θ) over a range of matric suctions. Carbon/nitrogen levels were determined from samples of the top 2.5cm of soil collected quarterly. Three year mean biomass added to the soil from sunn hemp ranged from 6.9 to 9.8Mgha−1, while that from crimson clover ranged from 3.3 to 5.0Mgha−1. The input of cover crop biomass increased soil C (0.3–4.7mgg−1) and N (0.1–0.5mgg−1), which contributed to improvements in soil structure and fertility. Significantly greater C (2.2mgg−1 vs. 1.8mgg−1), lower BD (1.71Mgm−3 vs. 1.73Mgm−3) and greater θ at field capacity (0.126 vs. 0.113cm3cm−3) were found in the rotations with sunn hemp as crop 1 as compared to rotations with fallow as crop 1. There were significant differences in BD, Ks, and θ between soil in the rows and that in the interrows for all treatments. In general, BD were lower, Ks were greater, and θ were greater in the rows than in the interrows. Overall the study indicated that high residue input from fall and winter cover crops is important for adding C, retaining plant-available N in organic matter, increasing fertilizer use efficiency, and improving soil physical properties in the very sandy soils of the southeastern (SE) USA coastal plain region.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of carbon (C) in soil is fundamentally affected by crop mix in diverse cropping systems, yet, little is known about C inputs from oilseed and pulse crops. This study determined carbon allocation coefficients in grain, straw, roots, and rhizodeposits for important oilseed and pulse crops in comparison with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under low-water (rainfall only) and high-water (rainfall plus irrigation) conditions. Three oilseeds [canola (Brassica napus L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)], and three pulses [chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), field pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.)], along with a wheat control were tested in Saskatchewan, Canada, in 2006 and 2007. Crops were grown in 15-cm diameter, 100-cm long metal lysimeters pushed into the field of medium-textured Aridic Haploboroll with the soil structure in lysimeters undisturbed. Root mass in the 0–100cm depth was greater (P{\textless}0.01) under irrigation than that under rainfall for wheat (126\% greater), flax (54\% greater), and mustard (14\% greater); there was no difference for dry pea; and was lower (P{\textless}0.01) under irrigation for chickpea (−16\%) and lentil (−35\%). Straw-to-root ratio averaged 4.90 under rainfall conditions and 6.22 under irrigation; the ratio differed among crop species only under rainfall conditions where the ratios for wheat (6.33), dry pea (5.35) and mustard (5.00) were greater than the ratios for canola, chickpea, and lentil. The relative C allocation coefficients in grain (Rg), straw (Rs), roots in the 0–100cm depth (Rr), and rhizodeposits (Re), expressed as estimated C input from each plant part in proportion to total C, varied among crop species. On average, the allocation coefficient for pulse crops (Rg:Rs:Rr:Re) was 0.24:0.46:0.18:0.12 under low-water, and 0.31:0.47:0.14:0.09 under high-water conditions. For oilseeds, the corresponding values were 0.17:0.58:0.15:0.10 for low-water, and 0.19:0.56:0.15:0.10 for high-water conditions. These C allocation coefficients in oilseeds and pulses should provide modellers with essential tools in quantifying C dynamics and soil C sequestration for agricultural systems involving broadleaved crop species.},

	abstract = {Soil management techniques, such as mulching, are used to enhance soil organic carbon sequestration. However, we demonstrate that the potential of crop residue mulching to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration varies by cropping system and soil type in Austrian agricultural soils. Effects of mulch (as harvested crop residues applied at 1.0 t C ha−1) on soil and microbial carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and soil δ13C were measured in an Austrian Cambisol field experiment with sole maize or vetch or vetch-maize rotation cropping systems after five years with or without mulching to elucidate how SOC is affected. The direct role of mulch on SOC in different soil types was also investigated in a similar greenhouse mesocosm study with controlled moisture using the same Cambisols and an Austrian agricultural Chernozem. Only sole maize cropping in the field experiment resulted in higher SOC with mulching and when legumes were included in a legume-maize rotation SOC did not improve. Mulching in the field experiment only resulted in higher SOC in the top 0–5 cm of soils with sole maize cropping (by 22\%) compared to soils without mulch. Although mulch did not increase SOC in vetch-maize rotation, the δ13C of SOC was less negative with mulch indicating larger C contribution from maize than vetch mulch. After four years of annual soybean-maize rotation in the mesocosm experiment, no significant differences in SOC were observed in Cambisols with or without mulch. Again, δ13C of both soil types was less negative with mulching indicating a larger C contribution from maize than soybean mulch. No relationships between microbial biomass C and N and SOC were observed in either experiment and only soil N concentration was positively correlated with SOC. Together these studies indicate that maize can increase SOC when crop residues are applied in Austrian Cambisols but that inclusion of legume production and legume mulch in rotation can mute these benefits.},

	abstract = {Reducing harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie, situated between the United States and Canada, requires implementing best management practices to decrease nutrient loading from upstream sources. Bi-national water quality targets have been set for total and dissolved phosphorus loads, with the ultimate goal of reaching these targets in 9-out-of-10 years. Row crop agriculture dominates the land use in the Western Lake Erie Basin thus requiring efforts to mitigate nutrient loads from agricultural systems. To determine the types and extent of agricultural management practices needed to reach the water quality goals, we used five independently developed Soil and Water Assessment Tool models to evaluate the effects of 18 management scenarios over a 10-year period on nutrient export. Guidance from a stakeholder group was provided throughout the project, and resulted in improved data, development of realistic scenarios, and expanded outreach. Subsurface placement of phosphorus fertilizers, cover crops, riparian buffers, and wetlands were among the most effective management options. But, only in one realistic scenario did a majority (3/5) of the models predict that the total phosphorus loading target would be met in 9-out-of-10 years. Further, the dissolved phosphorus loading target was predicted to meet the 9-out-of-10-year goal by only one model and only in three scenarios. In all scenarios evaluated, the 9-out-of-10-year goal was not met based on the average of model predictions. Ensemble modeling revealed general agreement about the effects of several practices although some scenarios resulted in a wide range of uncertainty. Overall, our results demonstrate that there are multiple pathways to approach the established water quality goals, but greater adoption rates of practices than those tested here will likely be needed to attain the management targets.},

HAB toxins cause a substantial but unquantified amount of human and animal morbidity and mortality from exposures in recreational, commercial, drinking-source and potable waters. HAB biomass and toxins threaten the sustainability of aquatic ecosystems. U.S. Congressional legislation mandated the establishment of a National Research Plan for Coastal Harmful Algal Blooms, but no similar plan exists for freshwater HABs (FHABs). Eutrophication and FHABs are conservatively estimated to cost the U.S. economy 2.2–4.6 billion dollars annually. A National Research Plan for Freshwater Harmful Algal Blooms is needed to develop U.S. policy and regulations or guidelines to confront FHAB risks. This report reviews the state of FHAB occurrence, risk and risk management assessments in the U.S. Research is identified that must be accomplished to characterize occurrence and risks, and develop cost effective strategies for preventing, suppressing and mitigating FHABs. U.S. Congressional legislation is needed to mandate a National Research Plan for FHABs, establish a timeline for developing policy and fund competitive research-grant programs. The research results will provide a sound scientific basis for making policy determinations and implementing risk management strategies. Successfully confronting FHAB risks will strengthen the U.S. economy, protect human and animal health and help ensure the sustainability of our Nation's freshwater bodies.},

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms can adversely affect fish communities, though their impacts are highly context-dependent and typically differ between fish species. Various approaches, comprising univariate and multivariate analyses and multimetric Fish Community Indices (FCI), were employed to characterise the perceived impacts of a Karlodinium veneficum bloom on the fish communities and ecological condition of the Swan Canning Estuary, Western Australia. The combined evidence suggests that a large proportion of the more mobile fish species in the offshore waters of the bloom-affected area relocated to other regions during the bloom. This was indicated by marked declines in mean species richness, catch rates and FCI scores in the bloom region but concomitant increases in these characteristics in more distal regions, and by pronounced and atypical shifts in the pattern of inter-regional similarities in fish community composition during the bloom. The lack of any significant changes among the nearshore fish communities revealed that bloom impacts were less severe there than in deeper, offshore waters. Nearshore habitats, which generally are in better ecological condition than adjacent offshore waters in this system, may provide refuges for fish during algal blooms and other perturbations, mirroring similar observations of fish avoidance responses to such stressors in estuaries worldwide.},

The nested logit ‘trick’ presented by Hensher and Bradley in 1993 [Hensher, D.A., Bradley, M., 1993. Using stated response data to enrich revealed preference discrete choice models. Marketing Letters 4 (2), 139–152] continues to be widely used, especially by practitioners, to accommodate scale differences. This modelling strategy has always assumed that the observations are independent, a condition of all GEV models, which is not strictly valid within a stated preference experiment with repeated choice sets and between each SP observation and the single RP data point. This paper promotes the replacement of the NL ‘trick’ method with an error components model that can accommodate correlated observations as well as reveal the relevant scale parameter for subsets of alternatives. Such a model can also incorporate “state” or reference dependence between data types and preference heterogeneity on observed attributes. An example illustrates the difference in empirical evidence.},

	abstract = {This paper examines a variety of issues within the context of two main themes: the formation of travel demand models and economic evaluation measures which are mutually consistent within a theory of rational choice; and a consideration of the structure of models which are representations of the trip decision process over several dimensions: location, mode, and route. Random utility theory is invoked to explore both the role and properties of composite costs or index prices in the ‘recursive’ approach to the structuring of travel choice models, and their significance in the economic evaluation problem. It is shown that the specification of these costs must be made very precisely, with respect to the demand model form chosen, in order to retain the underlying assumption that the traveller is an optimal decisionmaker. It is argued that the structure of ‘simultaneous’ models currently in use is inconsistent with the form of utility function assumed to generate those models. Furthermore, it is shown that the ‘simultaneous’ and ‘recursive’ forms are special cases of a more general choice model structure which takes specific account of correlation or ‘commonality’ of trip attributes., A number of applications are discussed in which consistent demand models and perceived user benefit measures are constructed. These include the formation of strategic transport planning models and of models for mixed-mode, multimode, and multiroute systems. The formalism allows definitive answers to be given to a number of problems of current interest in transportation planning, which have been incorrectly or incompletely treated.},

With the increasing popularity of the Mixed Multinomial Logit (MMNL) model, most applications now rely exclusively on a random coefficients approach in dealing with the repeated choice nature of the data. Here in turn, the assumption is generally made that tastes vary across respondents, but not across observations for the same respondent. In this paper, we question this assumption and show that it is important to also allow for variation in tastes across replications for the same respondent. Furthermore, the paper shows the benefits of accounting for correlation across replications for the same individual independently of the treatment of taste heterogeneity.},

Past experience heavily influenced decisions as places were sensed as a combination of setting, landscape, ritual, routine and in the context of other places.

Ten subjects made choices between 45 pairs of outdoor recreation sites during nine one-hour sessions. During the choice process they verbalized their thoughts and feelings into a tape recorder. These tapes were transcribed and the resulting verbal protocols were encoded for analysis. The codes, which represented the elements of the choice process, included symbolic and complex variables such as atmosphere, personal values, and memories, as well as more traditional elements such as site features and activities. The choice processes were characteristic of compensatory and non-compensatory decision models. The compensatory choices were characterized by the addition of positively- and negatively-evaluated elements, the chosen site having more positively assessed features. The non-compensatory process was characterized by the presence of criterion variables, the presence or absence of which determined the choices. The findings also illustrated the importance of personal values and experiences, as well as site features and activities, in the site choice process.},

	abstract = {Despite evidence that firms often combine more than one operation mode in a foreign market and that these mode combinations change over time, this phenomenon remains understudied. Drawing on the knowledge-based view, in this process study we explore how and why foreign operation mode combinations change over time. We build on a longitudinal case study, spanning 21 years of a firm's development in three Latin American countries, to identify and analyse four different mode combinations. Our findings show how operation modes are combined to enable several knowledge processes simultaneously, and that these combinations change in response to changing knowledge needs.
This paper addresses the growing but fragmented research area of changes in foreign operation modes. Previous research claims this field to be under-researched and at the same time more complex than hitherto assumed. Moreover, a majority of studies investigating mode change include the topic rather inexplicitly. In consequence, literature on mode change is fragmented across different research streams and is characterized by incoherent nomenclature, a variety of research foci as well as results that are hard to compare. By conducting a structured literature review we consolidate existing findings, provide a deeper understanding of firms’ foreign operation mode change, related theoretical perspectives, and its antecedents and consequences. Based on our findings we discuss relevant areas for future research in this research field.
A multinational enterprise’s (MNE) decision to commit more resources to a host country operation is a key aspect of internationalization. MNEs can change their foreign operation mode in several ways in order to increase host-country commitment after initial entry, but existing theory on mode changes provides little guidance on what drives MNEs to increase commitment in a certain way over another. In this paper, we differentiate between mode duplication, whereby an MNE replicates an existing operation mode in a host country, and mode elevation, whereby an MNE establishes a new, different mode of operation either in lieu of or in addition to an existing one. We subsequently leverage learning theory to argue that both deeper international experience and broader international experience increase the likelihood of implementing a mode elevation rather than a mode duplication due to the higher complexity of the former. We further argue that these relationships are not uniform across different levels of host-country institutional quality. We test our hypotheses in a primary dataset of 80 Austrian MNEs implementing 527 mode changes while internationalizing into 21 countries in Central and Eastern Europe over 24 years, and find support for our theory. Overall, this study contributes to the international business literature on mode changes by offering theory and evidence regarding the drivers of whether an MNE increases foreign commitment by establishing a new operation mode or by duplicating an existing one in a host country.
Taking the assumptions of the resource dependency theory as our starting point, the main objective of this investigation is to gain an understanding of how and in what way board members who serve on multiple boards (interlocks) can affect a firm's profitability, and whether it is useful to consider the derivation of these interlocks according to the type of board member (executive or non-executive) who possesses them. Using dynamic panel data analysis (GMM) and a sample of 88 firms quoted on the Spanish Continuous Market for the period 2005–2008, our results confirm the existence of a curvilinear (inverted-U) relation between interlocks and firm performance. The results demonstrate that this relation is only significant if we include the total number of external ties rather than just the number of links generated by non-executive directors. We can also confirm that the degree of familiarity and shared knowledge between board members (measured by average board tenure) affects this relationship.
Partiendo de los supuestos de la teoría de dependencia de recursos, el principal objetivo de esta investigación pasa por conocer cómo y de qué forma la pertenencia de los consejeros a múltiples consejos (interlocks) podría afectar a la rentabilidad de la empresa y si es importante considerar en esta relación la procedencia de los interlocks según la tipología del consejero que lo ostente (consejeros ejecutivos y no ejecutivos). Mediante un análisis de datos de panel dinámico (GMM), y a través de una muestra de 88 empresas cotizadas en el Mercado Continuo español para el periodo 2005–2008, los resultados obtenidos confirman que existe una relación curvilínea (en forma de U invertida) entre los interlocks y el rendimiento de la empresa, y que esta relación es sólo significativa si tenemos en cuenta el número total de vínculos externos, y no sólo cuando tomamos en número de vínculos generados por los consejeros no-ejecutivos. Asimismo, podemos afirman que el grado de familiaridad y conocimiento mutuo entre los miembros del consejo (medido por la permanencia media del consejo) influye sobre esta relación.
This paper adopts a qualitative approach based on the principles of grounded theory to investigate interdependencies between factors affecting the choice of market entry modes. A conceptual model is developed in the context of pharmaceutical companies expanding into transition economies. Building on Dunning’s eclectic theory, the case analysis indicates that both initial and subsequent entry mode decisions result from a changing trade-off between specific market potential and risk factors. Another conceptual contribution of the paper is that this interplay is moderated by product differentiation, prior experience in a similar context and cultural distance, which adds a new perspective to extant research. By using the construct of resource commitment level, the proposed framework accommodates for the fact that multiple entry modes, including non-transactional operations, can be selected in a given market. While the empirical study has an industry-related focus and thus generates practical insights, its implications for theory building are discussed in a broader perspective.},

	abstract = {To assess differences in the lag-effect pattern in the relationship between particulate matter less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and cause-specific mortality in Seoul, Korea, from January 1995 to December 1999, we performed a time-series analysis. We used a generalized additive Poisson regression model to control for time trends, temperature, humidity, air pressure, and the day of the week. The PM10 effect was estimated on the basis of the time-series models using the 24-h means and the quadratic distributed-lag models using a cumulative 6-day effect. One interquartile range increase in the 6-day cumulative mean of PM10 (43.12 µg/m3) was associated with an increase in non-accidental deaths [3.7\%, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.1, 5.4], respiratory disease (13.9\%, 95\% CI: 6.8, 21.5), cardiovascular disease (4.4\%, 95\% CI: –1.0, 9.0), and cerebrovascular disease (6.3\%, 95\% CI: 2.3, 10.5). We found the following patterns in the disease-specific lag-effect window: respiratory mortality was more affected by air pollution level on the day of death, whereas cardiovascular deaths were more affected by the previous day's air pollution level. Cerebrovascular deaths were simultaneously associated with the air pollution levels of the same day and the previous day. The patterns in the lag effect from the distributed-lag models were similar to those of a series of time-series models with 24-h means. These results contribute to our understanding of how exposure to air pollution causes adverse health effects.},

It illustrates how potential future climate change impacts can be integrated into a dynamic forestry economics model using data from a global dynamic vegetation model, the MC2 model. The results suggest that climate change will cause forest outputs (such as timber) to increase by approximately 30\% over the century. Aboveground forest carbon storage also is projected to increase, by approximately 26 Pg C by 2115, as a result of climate change, potentially providing an offset to emissions from other sectors. The effects of climate mitigation policies in the energy sector are then examined. When climate mitigation in the energy sector reduces warming, we project a smaller increase in forest outputs over the timeframe of the analysis, and we project a reduction in the sink capacity of forests of around 12 Pg C by 2115.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine the effectiveness of artificial neural networks for the classification of bare soils, and to compare alternative neural network architectures. A group of classifiers, based on feed-forward back-propagation neural networks, was trained with either satellite or aerial remote sensing data. These classifiers were considered as either experts, trained to classify more than one soil texture, or specialists, trained to identify only one of the soil textures. Committee machines (CMs) and specialist committee machines (SCMs) were generated by applying a stacked generalization voting scheme. Both Landsat images and panchromatic aerial photographs, which were taken from bare-soil farmland in the Delta area of Mississippi, were used as spectral radiance sources. Sample points collected from two fields based on a 0.4ha (1acre) grid were split into two non-overlapping subsets serving as training and test sets. By including the spectral radiance values from pixels surrounding the pixels where soil sample points were located in the data sets, contextual information of those sample points was included in the training. The impacts of contextual information of the sample points were investigated by analyzing the relationship between classifiers’ performance and the size of input matrices that were used to collect spectral radiance data. The analysis showed that both CMs and SCMs performed better than any single classifier. In particular, the SCMs achieved the best performance by taking advantage of the generalization ability of CMs and the focusing ability of a specialist classifier. Both spectral radiance and contextual information of the samples played important roles in soil texture classification. Compared to panchromatic aerial photographs, training based on multispectral Landsat images led to better performance. Classifiers, and the CMs and SCMs generated accordingly, performed well when applied to test data sets that were collected from the same fields from which the training data sets were collected. They performed relatively poorly when applied to test data sets that were collected from the fields other than those from which the training data sets were collected.},

The results show that these impacts are significant for most regions and soil layers, although they vary depending on soil texture classification, vegetation type, and season. The use of site-observed soil texture classification and vegetation type in the model does not necessarily improve anomaly correlations and reduce mean absolute error for soil moisture simulations. Instead, results are mixed when examining all regions and soil layers. This is attributed to the compensation effects (e.g., effect of ill-calibrated model parameters), as Noah has been more or less calibrated with model-specified soil texture classification and vegetation type. The site-based analysis shows that Noah can reasonably simulate the variation of daily evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and total runoff when soil texture classification (vegetation type) is corrected from loam (forest) to clay (grasslands) or vice versa. This suggests that the performance of Noah can be further improved by tuning model parameters when site-observed soil texture and vegetation type are used.},

	abstract = {Texture is one of the main properties affecting the accuracy of visible (vis) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy during on-the-go measurement of soil properties. Classification of soil spectra into predefined texture classes is expected to increase the accuracy of measurement of other soil properties using separate groups of calibration models, each developed for one texture class. A mobile, fibre-type, vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Zeiss Corona 1.7 vis-NIR fibre), with a light reflectance measurement range of 306.5–1710.9 nm was used to measure the light reflectance from fresh soil samples collected from many fields in Belgium and northern France. A total of 365 soil samples were classified into four different texture classes, namely, coarse sandy, fine sandy, loamy and clayey soils. The factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) was applied on the first five principal components obtained from the principal component analysis performed on the vis-NIR spectra in order to classify soils into the four assigned groups. Correct classification (CC) of 85.7\% and 81.8\% was observed for the calibration and validation data sets, respectively. However, validation of the vis-NIR-FDA technique on the validation set showed poor discrimination between the coarse sandy and fine sandy soil groups, with a great deal of overlapping. Therefore, the soil groups were reduced to three groups by combining the coarse sandy and fine sandy soil groups into one group and FDA was applied again. A better classification was obtained with CC of 89.9 and 85.1\% for the calibration and validation data sets, respectively. However, the CC for the sand group in the validation set was rather small (46.7\%), which was attributed to the small sample number and poor correlation between sand fraction and vis-NIR spectroscopy. It was concluded that vis-NIR-FDA is an efficient technique to classify soil into three main groups of sandy (light soils), loamy (medium soils) and clayey (heavy soils). Additional samples from the sandy and clayey groups should be included to improve the accuracy of the vis-NIR-FDA classification models to be used for an on-the-go vis-NIR measurement system of soil properties.},

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) balance is an important component of the terrestrial carbon (C) budget. However, effect of cropland management changes on SOC dynamics has not been recently assessed in the tropics. Studies were compiled in the tropics where SOC stocks were measured in the topsoil (0–20 or 0–30 cm depth) after the adoption of management practices that are expected to enhance SOC stocks, including tillage reduction, crop rotation, exogenous organic amendments, restitution of crop residues, mineral amendments, and combinations of these practices. Random forest regression was used to identify the determinants of SOC accumulation rates (ΔSOC) depending on the climate, soil characteristics and changes in management practices. 214 cases were identified in 48 studies in 13 different countries. The average ΔSOC was 0.41 ± 0.03 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 (significantly greater than zero), for an average experiment duration of 13.6 ± 0.6 years. Although a large part of the variability remained unexplained due to methodological bias in the studies or a lack of relevant predictors. The strongest predictors of ΔSOC were C inputs, duration of the experiments, and the management practices, whereas neither soil characteristics (soil type, clay content, and initial SOC stock) nor climate variables (mean annual temperature and rainfall, aridity index) affected ΔSOC. The SOC accumulation rates increased linearly with C inputs, and the conversion rate of C inputs to SOC was 8.2 ± 0.8\%. Given the competing uses of organic matter on many tropical farms, the benefits of using changes in management practices for climate change mitigation might be overrated. As ΔSOC decreased with the duration of the experiments, ΔSOC would probably be smaller if a period of 20 years were considered, as recommended by the IPCC guidelines. The management practice with the greatest ΔSOC was diversified crop rotation. Cropping systems where diverse practices were combined resulted in higher ΔSOC than individual practices such as reduced tillage and mineral fertilization on their own. The adoption of improved management practices that increase C inputs is still relevant for meeting the challenges of food security and adaptation to climate change.},

This paper reviews the literature for the influence of land use changes on soil C stocks and reports the results of a meta analysis of these data from 74 publications. The meta analysis indicates that soil C stocks decline after land use changes from pasture to plantation (−10\%), native forest to plantation (−13\%), native forest to crop (−42\%), and pasture to crop (−59\%). Soil C stocks increase after land use changes from native forest to pasture (+ 8\%), crop to pasture (+ 19\%), crop to plantation (+ 18\%), and crop to secondary forest (+ 53\%). Wherever one of the land use changes decreased soil C, the reverse process usually increased soil carbon and vice versa. As the quantity of available data is not large and the methodologies used are diverse, the conclusions drawn must be regarded as working hypotheses from which to design future targeted investigations that broaden the database. Within some land use changes there were, however, sufficient examples to explore the role of other factors contributing to the above conclusions. One outcome of the meta analysis, especially worthy of further investigation in the context of carbon sink strategies for greenhouse gas mitigation, is that broadleaf tree plantations placed onto prior native forest or pastures did not affect soil C stocks whereas pine plantations reduced soil C stocks by 12–15\%.},

	abstract = {Land-use changes are the second largest source of human-induced greenhouse gas emission, mainly due to deforestation in the tropics and subtropics. CO2 emissions result from biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses and may be offset with afforestation programs. However, the effect of land-use changes on SOC is poorly quantified due to insufficient data quality (only SOC concentrations and no SOC stocks, shallow sampling depth) and representativeness. In a global meta-analysis, 385 studies on land-use change in the tropics were explored to estimate the SOC stock changes for all major land-use change types. The highest SOC losses were caused by conversion of primary forest into cropland (−25\%) and perennial crops (−30\%) but forest conversion into grassland also reduced SOC stocks by 12\%. Secondary forests stored less SOC than primary forests (−9\%) underlining the importance of primary forests for C stores. SOC losses are partly reversible if agricultural land is afforested (+29\%) or under cropland fallow (+32\%) and with cropland conversion into grassland (+26\%). Data on soil bulk density are critical in order to estimate SOC stock changes because (i) the bulk density changes with land-use and needs to be accounted for when calculating SOC stocks and (ii) soil sample mass has to be corrected for bulk density changes in order to compare land-use types on the same basis of soil mass. Without soil mass correction, land-use change effects would have been underestimated by 28\%. Land-use change impact on SOC was not restricted to the surface soil, but relative changes were equally high in the subsoil, stressing the importance of sufficiently deep sampling.},

	abstract = {World soils and terrestrial ecosystems have been a source of atmospheric abundance of CO2 ever since settled agriculture began about 10–13 millennia ago. The amount of CO2-C emitted into the atmosphere is estimated at 136 ± 55 Pg from terrestrial ecosystems, of which emission from world soils is estimated at 78 ± 12 Pg. Conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems decreases soil organic carbon (SOC) pool by 30–50\% over 50–100 years in temperate regions, and 50–75\% over 20–50 years in tropical climates. The projected global warming, with estimated increase in mean annual temperature of 4–6°C by 2100, may have a profound impact on the total soil C pool and its dynamics. The SOC pool may increase due to increase in biomass production and accretion into the soil due to the so-called “CO2 fertilization effect”, which may also enhance production of the root biomass. Increase in weathering of silicates due to increase in temperature, and that of the formation of secondary carbonates due to increase in partial pressure of CO2 in soil air may also increase the total C pool. In contrast, however, SOC pool may decrease because of: (i) increase in rate of respiration and mineralization, (ii) increase in losses by soil erosion, and (iii) decrease in protective effects of stable aggregates which encapsulate organic matter. Furthermore, the relative increase in temperature projected to be more in arctic and boreal regions, will render Cryosols under permafrost from a net sink to a net source of CO2 if and when permafrost thaws. Thus, SOC pool of world soils may decrease with increase in mean global temperature. In contrast, the biotic pool may increase primarily because of the CO2 fertilization effect. The magnitude of CO2 fertilization effect may be constrained by lack of essential nutrients (e.g., N, P) and water. The potential of SOC sequestration in agricultural soils of Europe is 70–190 Tg C yr−1. This potential is realizable through adoption of recommended land use and management, and restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems including wetlands.},

	abstract = {Agricultural land devoted to vegetable crops in the Caribbean has strongly increased during the past twenty years, which raises major concerns regarding a reduction in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks because of low C inputs and high SOC outputs from these cropping systems. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of farming practices on SOC stocks at the farm type level. We designed a framework which encompasses a farm typology describing the diversity of farm practices applied to vegetable crops and a model of SOC dynamics to estimate the impact of these practices on SOC stocks. The study was carried out in the Guadeloupe archipelago, which offers a good representation of the variability of Caribbean agriculture, in a context of transition from traditional sugarcane and banana monocultures for export to a more diversified agriculture including vegetable crops. A farm typology was developed from a survey of 71 farmers concerning their socio-economic characteristics and farming practices. The MorGwanik model of SOC dynamics was then used to assess the impact of farming practices on SOC at the farm type level, and to interpret the observed SOC changes. Five farm types were identified varying from traditional export agriculture with low diversification to monoculture of vegetable crops based on compost application and reduced soil tillage. The observed and simulated results indicated that systems with a fallow/vegetables cycle ratio{\textgreater}2 and the monoculture of vegetables including compost applications at ≥10Mgha−1yr−1 presented C sequestration corresponding to SOC increases of 10\% and 3\% of the initial stock, respectively. The monoculture of vegetables with a compost rate{\textless}10Mgha−1yr−1 and systems including vegetables in rotation with export crops and a short fallow cycle presented a reduction in SOC that ranged from 10\% to 18\%. Pedoclimatic conditions had a lower impact on SOC changes. Similar socio-economic profiles of farmers were observed for farm types including very different cropping systems. The model well described SOC changes for each farm type and offered valuable insights about the factors affecting SOC losses and C sequestration. The framework proposed in this study was helpful to identify improved managements that can maintain or increase SOC stocks under tropical conditions.},

	abstract = {Bioenergy crops are expected to provide biomass to replace fossil resources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In this context, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are of primary importance. The aim of this study was to measure changes in SOC stocks in bioenergy cropping systems comparing perennial (Miscanthus × giganteus and switchgrass), semi-perennial (fescue and alfalfa), and annual (sorghum and triticale) crops, all established after arable crops. The soil was sampled at the start of the experiment and 5 or 6 years later. SOC stocks were calculated at equivalent soil mass, and δ13C measurements were used to calculate changes in new and old SOC stocks. Crop residues found in soil at the time of SOC measurements represented 3.5–7.2 t C ha−1 under perennial crops vs. 0.1–0.6 t C ha−1 for the other crops. During the 5-year period, SOC concentrations under perennial crops increased in the surface layer (0–5 cm) and slightly declined in the lower layers. Changes in δ13C showed that C inputs were mainly located in the 0–18 cm layer. In contrast, SOC concentrations increased over time under semi-perennial crops throughout the old ploughed layer (ca. 0–33 cm). SOC stocks in the old ploughed layer increased significantly over time under semi-perennials with a mean increase of 0.93 ± 0.28 t C ha−1 yr−1, whereas no change occurred under perennial or annual crops. New SOC accumulation was higher for semi-perennial than for perennial crops (1.50 vs. 0.58 t C ha−1 yr−1, respectively), indicating that the SOC change was due to a variation in C input rather than a change in mineralization rate. Nitrogen fertilization rate had no significant effect on SOC stocks. This study highlights the interest of comparing SOC changes over time for various cropping systems.},

	abstract = {Process-based model analyses are often used to estimate changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), particularly at regional to continental scales. However, uncertainties are rarely evaluated, and so it is difficult to determine how much confidence can be placed in the results. Our objective was to quantify uncertainties across multiple scales in a process-based model analysis, and provide 95\% confidence intervals for the estimates. Specifically, we used the Century ecosystem model to estimate changes in SOC stocks for US croplands during the 1990s, addressing uncertainties in model inputs, structure and scaling of results from point locations to regions and the entire country. Overall, SOC stocks increased in US croplands by 14.6 Tg C yr−1 from 1990 to 1995 and 17.5 Tg C yr−1 during 1995 to 2000, and uncertainties were ±22\% and ±16\% for the two time periods, respectively. Uncertainties were inversely related to spatial scale, with median uncertainties at the regional scale estimated at ±118\% and ±114\% during the early and latter part of 1990s, and even higher at the site scale with estimates at ±739\% and ±674\% for the time periods, respectively. This relationship appeared to be driven by the amount of the SOC stock change; changes in stocks that exceeded 200 Gg C yr−1 represented a threshold where uncertainties were always lower than ±100\%. Consequently, the amount of uncertainty in estimates derived from process-based models will partly depend on the level of SOC accumulation or loss. In general, the majority of uncertainty was associated with model structure in this application, and so attaining higher levels of precision in the estimates will largely depend on improving the model algorithms and parameterization, as well as increasing the number of measurement sites used to evaluate the structural uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Sequestration of atmospheric carbon (C) into soils is a strategy to compensate for anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. The response of SOCs to crop types is yet to be determined under different environments. The objectives of this study were to elucidate the impact of crop type on the allocation of atmospheric C to shoots and roots, and ultimately to the soils and to determine its association with soil carbon stocks. Three hundred and eighty-nine field trials were compared to determine allocation of biomass and C in plants and SOCs under fields of different crop types. Grasses had the highest plant biomass production (19.80±1.16Mgha−1yr−1), followed by cereals (9.44±0.45Mgha−1yr−1), fibre (7.90±1.00Mgha−1yr−1), legumes (3.29±0.63Mgha−1yr−1), and oil crops (3.05±1.16Mgha−1yr−1) showing significant differences (p{\textless}0.05). Maize (6.3±0.34 MgCha−1yr−1) had the highest plant C amongst summer crops, while wheat (2.2±0.35MgCha−1yr−1) had the highest plant C amongst winter crops. In all the studies, crops allocated more C to their shoots than roots yielding root C: shoot C (Rc/Sc) ratios below magnitude. The greatest C allocation to roots was in grasses (Rc/Sc=1.19±0.08), followed by cereals (0.95±0.03), legumes (0.86±0.04), oil crops (0.85±0.08), and fibre crops (0.50±0.07). There was evidence that high plant C stocks were found in crops grown under carbon rich clayey soils of tropical humid areas. Natural grasses and cereals should be promoted as they appeared to yield greater potential for atmospheric carbon sequestration in plants and soils. Overall, the study evaluated the relative potential of the main crop types to sequester atmospheric C useful in screening of crop types for carbon efficiency and for development of plant C models.},

This paper provides analyses from 446 sites worldwide to evaluate the impact of environmental factors (MAP and MAT: mean annual precipitation and temperature; CLAY and BD: soil clay content and bulk density; S: slope gradient; LU: land use) on annual exports (RC: runoff coefficients; SL: sediment loads; TOCL: organic carbon losses; TNL: nitrogen losses; TPL: phosphorus losses) from different spatial scales. RC was found to increase, on average, from 18\% at local scale (in headwaters), 25\% at microcatchment and subcatchment scale (midreaches) to 41\% at catchment scale (lower reaches of river basins) in response to multiple factors. SL increased from microplots (468 g m−2 yr−1) to plots (901 g m−2 yr−1), accompanied by decreasing TOCL and TNL. Climate was a major control masking the effects of other factors. For example, RC, SL, TOCL, TNL, and TPL tended to increase with MAP at all spatial scales. These variables, however, decreased with MAT. The impact of CLAY, BD, LU, and S on erosion variables was largely confined to the hillslope scale, where RC, SL, and TOCL decreased with CLAY, while TNL and TPL increased. The results contribute to better understanding of water, nutrient, and carbon cycles in terrestrial ecosystems and should inform river basin modeling and ecosystem management. The important role of spatial climate variability points to a need for comparative research in specific environments at nested spatiotemporal scales.},

	abstract = {Monitoring agricultural land is important for understanding and managing food production, environmental conservation efforts, and climate change. The United States Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL), an annual satellite imagery-derived land cover map, has been increasingly used for this application since complete coverage of the conterminous United States became available in 2008. However, the CDL is designed and produced with the intent of mapping annual land cover rather than tracking changes over time, and as a result certain precautions are needed in multi-year change analyses to minimize error and misapplication. We highlight scenarios that require special considerations, suggest solutions to key challenges, and propose a set of recommended good practices and general guidelines for CDL-based land change estimation. We also characterize a problematic issue of crop area underestimation bias within the CDL that needs to be accounted for and corrected when calculating changes to crop and cropland areas. When used appropriately and in conjunction with related information, the CDL is a valuable and effective tool for detecting diverse trends in agriculture. By explicitly discussing the methods and techniques for post-classification measurement of land-cover and land-use change using the CDL, we aim to further stimulate the discourse and continued development of suitable methodologies. Recommendations generated here are intended specifically for the CDL but may be broadly applicable to additional remotely-sensed land cover datasets including the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based land cover products, and other regional, national, and global land cover classification maps.},

	abstract = {The ‘4 per mille Soils for Food Security and Climate’ was launched at the COP21 with an aspiration to increase global soil organic matter stocks by 4 per 1000 (or 0.4 \%) per year as a compensation for the global emissions of greenhouse gases by anthropogenic sources. This paper surveyed the soil organic carbon (SOC) stock estimates and sequestration potentials from 20 regions in the world (New Zealand, Chile, South Africa, Australia, Tanzania, Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, India, China Taiwan, South Korea, China Mainland, United States of America, France, Canada, Belgium, England \& Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and Russia). We asked whether the 4 per mille initiative is feasible for the region. The outcomes highlight region specific efforts and scopes for soil carbon sequestration. Reported soil C sequestration rates globally show that under best management practices, 4 per mille or even higher sequestration rates can be accomplished. High C sequestration rates (up to 10 per mille) can be achieved for soils with low initial SOC stock (topsoil less than 30tCha−1), and at the first twenty years after implementation of best management practices. In addition, areas which have reached equilibrium will not be able to further increase their sequestration. We found that most studies on SOC sequestration only consider topsoil (up to 0.3m depth), as it is considered to be most affected by management techniques. The 4 per mille number was based on a blanket calculation of the whole global soil profile C stock, however the potential to increase SOC is mostly on managed agricultural lands. If we consider 4 per mille in the top 1m of global agricultural soils, SOC sequestration is between 2-3GtCyear−1, which effectively offset 20–35\% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. As a strategy for climate change mitigation, soil carbon sequestration buys time over the next ten to twenty years while other effective sequestration and low carbon technologies become viable. The challenge for cropping farmers is to find disruptive technologies that will further improve soil condition and deliver increased soil carbon. Progress in 4 per mille requires collaboration and communication between scientists, farmers, policy makers, and marketeers.},

Most recent scenarios from integrated assessment models require large-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies (NETs) to reach the 2 °C target. A recent analysis of NETs, including direct air capture, enhanced weathering, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation/deforestation, showed that all NETs have significant limits to implementation, including economic cost, energy requirements, land use, and water use. In this paper, I assess the potential for negative emissions from soil carbon sequestration and biochar addition to land, and also the potential global impacts on land use, water, nutrients, albedo, energy and cost. Results indicate that soil carbon sequestration and biochar have useful negative emission potential (each 0.7 GtCeq. yr−1) and that they potentially have lower impact on land, water use, nutrients, albedo, energy requirement and cost, so have fewer disadvantages than many NETs. Limitations of soil carbon sequestration as a NET centre around issues of sink saturation and reversibility. Biochar could be implemented in combination with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Current integrated assessment models do not represent soil carbon sequestration or biochar. Given the negative emission potential of SCS and biochar and their potential advantages compared to other NETs, efforts should be made to include these options within IAMs, so that their potential can be explored further in comparison with other NETs for climate stabilization.},

	abstract = {Soil carbon (C) sequestration is one of three main approaches to carbon dioxide removal and storage through management of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil C sequestration relies of the adoption of improved management practices that increase the amount of carbon stored as soil organic matter, primarily in cropland and grazing lands. These C sequestering practices act by increasing the rate of input of plant-derived residues to soils and/or by reducing the rates of turnover of organic C stocks already in the soil. In addition to carbon dioxide removal potential, increases in soil organic matter/soil C content are highly beneficial from the standpoint of soil health and soil fertility. Practices to increase soil C stocks include well-known, proven techniques, or “best management practices” (BMP) for building soil carbon. A second category includes what we refer to as frontier technologies for which significant technological and/or economic barriers exist today, but for which further R\&D and/or economic incentives might offer the potential for greater sequestration over the longer term. We reviewed published estimates of global soil carbon sequestration potential, representing the biophysical potential for managed cropland and/or grassland systems to store additional carbon assuming widespread (near complete) adoption of BMPs. The majority of studies suggests that 4–5 GtCO2/y as an upper limit for global biophysical potential with near complete adoption of BMPs. In the longer-term, if frontier technologies are successfully deployed, the global estimate might grow to 8 GtCO2/y. There is a strong scientific basis for managing agricultural soils to act as a significant carbon (C) sink over the next several decades. A two-stage strategy, to first incentivize adoption of well-developed, conventional soil C sequestering practices, while investing in R\&D on new frontier technologies that could come on-line in the next 2–3 decades, could maximize benefits. Implementation of such policies will require robust, scientifically-sound measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems to track that policy goals are being met and that claimed increases in soil C stocks are real.},

	abstract = {Soil organic matter has recently been implicated as an important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the relative impacts of various agricultural management practices on soil organic matter dynamics and, therefore, C sequestration at spatial scales larger than a single plot or times longer than the typical three year experiment have rarely been reported. Results of maintaining agricultural management practices in the forest-derived soils of the eastern Corn (Zea mays L.) Belt states of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania (USA) were studied. We found annual organic C input and tillage intensity were the most important factors in affecting C sequestration. The impact of rotation on C sequestration was primarily related to the way it altered annual total C inputs. The removal of above-ground plant biomass and use of cover crops were of lesser importance. The most rapid changes in soil organic matter content occurred during the first five years after a management practice was imposed with slower changes occurring thereafter. Certain management practices, e.g. no-tillage (NT), increased the soil's ability to sequester atmospheric CO2. The impact of this sequestration will be significant only when these practices are used extensively on a large percentage of cropland and when the C-building practices are maintained. Any soil C sequestered will be rapidly mineralized to CO2 if the soil organic matter building practices are not maintained.},

	abstract = {In the North American northern Great Plains (NGP), legumes are promising summer fallow replacement/cropping intensification options that may decrease dependence on nitrogen (N) fertilizer in small grain systems and mitigate effects of soil organic matter (SOM) losses from summer fallow. Benefits may not be realized immediately in semiarid conditions though, and longer-term effects of legumes and intensified cropping in this region are unclear, particularly in no-till systems. We compared effects of four no-till wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systems–summer fallow–wheat (F–W), continuous wheat (CW), legume green manure (pea, Pisum sativum L.)—wheat (LGM–W), and pea–wheat (P–W)—on select soil attributes in an 8-year-old rotation study, and N fertilizer effects on C and N mineralization on a duplicate soil set in a laboratory experiment. We analyzed potentially mineralizable carbon and nitrogen (PMC and PMN) and mineralization trends with a nonlinear model, microbial biomass carbon (MB-C), and wet aggregate stability (WAS). Legume-containing systems generally resulted in higher PMC, PMN, and MB-C, while intensified systems (CW and P–W) had higher WAS. Half-lives of PMC were shortest in intensified systems, and were longest in legume systems (LGM–W and P–W) for PMN. Nitrogen addition depressed C and N mineralization, particularly in CW, and generally shortened the half-life of mineralizable C. Legumes may increase long-term, no-till NGP agroecosystem resilience and sustainability by (1) increasing the available N-supply ({\textasciitilde}26–50 \%) compared to wheat-only systems, thereby reducing the need for N fertilizer for subsequent crops, and (2) by potentially mitigating negative effects of SOM loss from summer fallow.},

	abstract = {The DAYCENT ecosystem model (a daily version of CENTURY) and an emission factor (EF) methodology used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were used to estimate direct and indirect N2O emission for major cropping systems in the USA. The EF methodology is currently used for the USA greenhouse gas inventory but process based models, such as DAYCENT, may yield more reliable results because they account for factors such as soil type, climate, and tillage intensity that are ignored by EF. Comparison of mean annual soil N2O flux estimated by DAYCENT and EF with measured data for different cropping systems yielded r2 values of 0.74 and 0.67, and mean deviations of −6 and +13\%, respectively. At the national scale, DAYCENT simulation of total N2O emission was ∼25\% lower than estimated using EF. For both models, N2O emission was highest in the central USA followed by the northwest, southwest, southeast, and northeast regions. The models simulated roughly equivalent direct N2O emission from fertilized crops, but EF estimated greater direct N2O emission than DAYCENT for N-fixing crops. DAYCENT and EF estimates of the gaseous component of indirect N2O emission (NO+NH3) differed little, but DAYCENT estimated approximately twice the indirect emission from NO3 leaching since it included the contribution of N from N-fixing crops while EF did not. DAYCENT simulations were also performed for no tillage cropping, pre-1940 crop management, and native vegetation. DAYCENT-simulated N2O, CO2, and CH4 fluxes were converted to CO2–C equivalents and combined with fuel use estimates to estimate net global warming potential (GWPnet). GWPnet for recent non-rice (Oryza sativa L.) major cropping was 0.43MgCha−1yr−1 under conventional tillage and 0.29MgCha−1yr−1 under no tillage, for pre-industrial cropping was 0.25MgCha−1yr−1, and for native systems was −0.15MgCha−1yr−1. Results from DAYCENT suggest that conversion to no tillage at the national scale could mitigate ∼20\% of USA agricultural emission or ∼1.5\% of total USA emission of greenhouse gases.},

There is general agreement that the technical potential for sequestration of carbon in soil is significant, and some consensus on the magnitude of that potential. Croplands worldwide could sequester between 0.90 and 1.85 Pg C/yr, i.e. 26–53\% of the target of the “4p1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate”. The importance of intensively cultivated regions such as North America, Europe, India and intensively cultivated areas in Africa, such as Ethiopia, is highlighted. Soil carbon sequestration and the conservation of existing soil carbon stocks, given its multiple benefits including improved food production, is an important mitigation pathway to achieve the less than 2 °C global target of the Paris Climate Agreement.},

	abstract = {Grasslands are heavily relied upon for food and forage production. A key component for sustaining production in grassland ecosystems is the maintenance of soil organic matter (SOM), which can be strongly influenced by management. Many management techniques intended to increase forage production may potentially increase SOM, thus sequestering atmospheric carbon (C). Further, conversion from either cultivation or native vegetation into grassland could also sequester atmospheric carbon. We reviewed studies examining the influence of improved grassland management practices and conversion into grasslands on soil C worldwide to assess the potential for C sequestration. Results from 115 studies containing over 300 data points were analyzed. Management improvements included fertilization (39\%), improved grazing management (24\%), conversion from cultivation (15\%) and native vegetation (15\%), sowing of legumes (4\%) and grasses (2\%), earthworm introduction (1\%), and irrigation (1\%). Soil C content and concentration increased with improved management in 74\% of the studies, and mean soil C increased with all types of improvement. Carbon sequestration rates were highest during the first 40 yr after treatments began and tended to be greatest in the top 10 cm of soil. Impacts were greater in woodland and grassland biomes than in forest, desert, rain forest, or shrubland biomes. Conversion from cultivation, the introduction of earthworms, and irrigation resulted in the largest increases. Rates of C sequestration by type of improvement ranged from 0.11 to 3.04 Mg C·ha−1 yr−1, with a mean of 0.54 Mg C·ha−1·yr−1, and were highly influenced by biome type and climate. We conclude that grasslands can act as a significant carbon sink with the implementation of improved management.},

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important reservoir for atmospheric CO2 associated with climate warming. The High Plains, USA, lacks region-wide SOC estimates within playa wetlands and their adjacent watershed. Croplands often have less SOC than grasslands, and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP; former croplands planted to grass) may return SOC. Our goals were to estimate SOC within playa wetlands and investigate small scale differences within wetland catchments across a broad agriculturally modified landscape. We estimated SOC (kgm−2) to 50cm depth from 4 soil cores/catchment (in playas and 10, 40 and 100m into uplands) at 56, 52, and 54 sites in native grassland, CRP and cropland, respectively. At a subset of sample locations within each land use type, we estimated SOC to 1m depth to characterize SOC missed by shallow sampling. In playa wetlands, CRP SOC from 0 to 50cm was 18\% greater than croplands, but native grassland playa SOC did not differ from other land-uses. From 0 to 1m, SOC in native grassland wetlands and uplands was 20\% greater than the same habitats within croplands, while CRP lands were intermediate. Native grassland playa SOC also was 16\% greater than in surrounding native short grass prairie. Playas therefore represent an important SOC repository in the High Plains ecoregion. CRP playas and uplands may require an additional 10–30 years to resemble native grassland SOC. SOC increased with playa area throughout CRP and native grassland catchments, suggesting playa hydrogeomorphology influences adjacent upland SOC. High Plains playas store 20.8Tg C and cropland conversion caused a cumulative loss of 2.0Tg C from 82,000ha of playas. Currently, CRP enrollment on over 25,000ha of playas has returned 0.2Tg C (95\% CI: 0.1–0.3), only half the historic SOC lost by cropland conversion within CRP playas. To promote SOC storage, native grasslands and large playas should be preserved and CRP enrollments should be maintained over long timescales.},

	abstract = {Assessments of the global carbon (C) cycle typically rely on simplified models which consider large areas as homogeneous in terms of the response of soils to land use or consider very broad land classes. For example, “cropland” is typically modelled as an aggregation of distinct practices and individual crops over large regions. Here, we use the process-based Rothamsted soil Carbon Model (RothC model), which has a history of being successfully applied at a global scale, to calculate attainable SOC stocks and C mineralization rates for each of c. 17,000 regions (combination of soil type and texture, climate type, initial land use and country) in the World, under near-past climate conditions. We considered 28 individual crops and, for each, multiple production practices, plus 16 forest types and 1 grassland class (total of 80 classes). We find that conversion to cropland can result in SOC increases, particularly when the soil remains covered with crop residues (an average gain of 12 t C/ha) or using irrigation (4 t C/ha), which are mutually reinforcing effects. Attainable SOC stocks vary significantly depending on the land use class, particularly for cropland. Common aggregations in global modelling of a single agricultural class would be inaccurate representations of these results. Attainable SOC stocks obtained here were compared to long-term experiment data and are well aligned with the literature. Our results provide a regional and detailed understanding of C sequestration that will also enable better greenhouse gas reporting at national level as alternatives to IPCC tier 2 defaults.},

This study investigated the effects of changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) content and other physical soil properties over a 12-year period in three adjacent ecosystems in a Mediterranean plateau. The ecosystems were cropland (converted from grasslands in 1990), open forest, and grassland. Soil samples from two depths, 0–10 and 10–20cm, were collected for chemical and physical analyses at each of cropland, open forest, and grassland ecosystems. SOC pools at the 0–20cm depth of cropland, forest, and grassland ecosystems were estimated at 32,636, 56,480, and 57,317kgha−1, respectively. Conversion of grassland into cropland during the 12-year period increased the bulk density by 10.5\% and soil erodibility by 46.2\%; it decreased SOM by 48.8\%, SOC content by 43\%, available water capacity (AWC) by 30.5\%, and total porosity by 9.1\% for the 0–20cm soil depth (p{\textless}0.001). The correlation matrix revealed that SOC content was positively correlated with AWC, total porosity, mean weight diameter (MWD), forest, and grassland, and negatively with bulk density, pH, soil erodibility factor, and cropland. The multiple regression (MLR) models indicated that any two of the three ecosystems and one of the two soil depths accounted for 86.5\% of variation in mean SOC values ((p{\textless}0.001).},

This study investigated the effects of changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) content and other physical soil properties over a 12-year period in three adjacent ecosystems in a Mediterranean plateau. The ecosystems were cropland (converted from grasslands in 1990), open forest, and grassland. Soil samples from two depths, 0–10 and 10–20cm, were collected for chemical and physical analyses at each of cropland, open forest, and grassland ecosystems. SOC pools at the 0–20cm depth of cropland, forest, and grassland ecosystems were estimated at 32,636, 56,480, and 57,317kgha−1, respectively. Conversion of grassland into cropland during the 12-year period increased the bulk density by 10.5\% and soil erodibility by 46.2\%; it decreased SOM by 48.8\%, SOC content by 43\%, available water capacity (AWC) by 30.5\%, and total porosity by 9.1\% for the 0–20cm soil depth (p{\textless}0.001). The correlation matrix revealed that SOC content was positively correlated with AWC, total porosity, mean weight diameter (MWD), forest, and grassland, and negatively with bulk density, pH, soil erodibility factor, and cropland. The multiple regression (MLR) models indicated that any two of the three ecosystems and one of the two soil depths accounted for 86.5\% of variation in mean SOC values ((p{\textless}0.001).},

	abstract = {Capturing the variability in soil-landscape properties is a challenge for grain producers attempting to integrate spatial information into the decision process of precision agriculture (PA). Digital soil maps (DSMs) use traditional soil survey information and can be the basis for PA subfield delineation (e.g., management zones). However, public soil survey maps provide only general descriptions of soil-landscape features. Therefore, improved DSMs are needed that use high-resolution data that more precisely model soil-landscape characteristics. Additionally, reliable methods are needed to validate DSM products for PA. The objective of this study was to validate with corn (Zea mays L.) yield data the performance of a new DSM product, termed Environmental Response Unit (ERU), compared with the USDA Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) soil map. The ERU was developed by integrating SSURGO information with high-resolution elevation data. For validation, corn yield maps were collected and corrected for common data collection errors from 409 fields across Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, and Nebraska in 2010 to 2012. Reductions in the area-weighted variance (Rv) of corn yield for ERU and SSURGO were calculated relative to the whole-field variance. The average Rv across all site-years for SSURGO and ERU was 16 and 25\%, respectively, which equated to a 57\% higher median yield variance reduction with ERU over SSURGO. This variance reduction technique showed the potential of ERU as an improved model better representing soil-landscape properties that impact corn yield. This research also has application potential for determining the success of a DSM for identifying management zones in PA. The variance reduction metric (Rv) provided a direct comparison between DSM models. The greatest reduction in corn yield variance was exhibited by the ERU DSM model. Physiographic derivatives from high-precision data sets improved DSM functionality. Yield data helped outline interrelationships among various soil properties.},

	abstract = {Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], the backbone of Midwestern crop production, respond to rotation, but how growing conditions affect this is not well documented. Our objectives were to determine the effect of various corn and soybean cropping patterns on yields and to evaluate environmental effects on the rotation effect. The study began in 1981 at Lamberton, MN, on a Webster clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquoll), in 1982 at Waseca, MN, on a Nicollet clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Hapludoll), and in 1983 at Arlington, WI, on a Plano silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Typic Argiudoll). Cropping sequences were (i) continuous monoculture of each crop; (ii) annual rotation of the two crops; and (iii) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 yr of each crop following 5 yr of the other crop. Results are based on 11 yr of data at Lamberton, 8 yr (soybean) or 9 yr (corn) at Waseca, and 9 yr at Arlington. Corn rotated annually with soybean yielded 13\% more, and 1st-yr corn following multiple years of soybean yielded 15\% more than continuous corn. Soybean annually rotated with corn yielded 10\% more, and 1st-yr soybean following multiple years of corn yielded 18\% more than continuous soybean. The crops differed in response to increasing years of consecutive planting: 2nd-yr to 5th-yr corn yields were no different from continuous corn yields; 2nd-yr soybean yielded 8\% more than continuous soybean, 3rd-yr soybean yielded 3\% more, and 4th- and 5th-yr soybean yielded the same as continuous soybean. Relative increase in yields of both crops in annual rotation compared with monoculture was approximately twofold greater in low-yielding than in high-yielding environments. In low-yielding environments, the yield advantage of an annual rotation of corn and soybean compared with monoculture was frequently greater than 25\%. The commonly practiced annual rotation of corn and soybean maximized corn yields, but not soybean yields, relative to the other sequences studied.},

We assessed crop sequence and tillage effects on SOC dynamics and storage using natural 13C abundance of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.), Merr.]. Treatments consisted of tillage: moldboard plow (MP), chisel plow (CP), and no-tillage (NT); and crop sequence: continuous corn (CC), continuous soybean (SS), and alternating corn–soybean (CS). Soil samples were collected after 14 yr in each treatment and in fallow alley-ways and were analyzed for SOC, δ13C, bulk density, and pH. Tillage by crop sequence interactions occurred as treatments with MP and SS as well as fallow averaged 135 Mg SOC ha−1 (0- to 45-cm depth), while CP treatments with corn (CC and CS) and NT with CC averaged 164 Mg SOC ha−1 Crop sequence effects on SOC (0- to 45-cm depth) occurred when tillage was reduced with CP and NT averaging 15\% greater SOC in CC than SS. In addition to less C inputs than CC, SS accelerated rates of SOC decomposition. Tillage effects on SOC were greatest in CC where CP had 26\% and NT 20\% more SOC than MP, whereas SOC in SS was similar across tillage treatments. Up to 33\% of the greater SOC under CC for CP and NT, compared with MP, occurred below tillage operating depths. Substantial losses of SOC were estimated (1.6 Mg SOC ha−1 yr−1) despite lowering SOC decay rates with reduced tillage and high levels of C inputs with CC.},

Soil physical, chemical, and biological properties were measured in a long-term cropping system study in the Western Corn Belt. Properties were evaluated after 16 yr in four crop sequences [continuous corn (zea mays L.) (CC), corn–soybean [Glycine max. (L.)] (C–SB), corn–oat (Avena sativa L.) + clover (80\% sweet clover [Melilotus officinalis L.] and 20\% red clover [Trifolium pratense L.])–grain sorghum [(Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)–soybean (C–OCL–SG–SB), and corn–soybean-grain sorghum–oat + clover (C–SB–SG–OCL)] each at three N fertilization rates (ZERO, LOW, and HIGH) to a soil depth of 30.5 cm on a Sharpsburg silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Argiudolls). Nitrogen fertilization had a greater impact on soil properties than crop sequence, with management effects most pronounced at 0 to 7.6 cm. Increased N rate resulted in greater organic C, total N, and particulate organic matter (POM), but lower soil pH. Increased N rate also reduced microbial biomass by ∼20\% between the HIGH and ZERO N-rate treatments. The C–SB–SG–OCL sequence possessed more potentially mineralizable N (PMN) (57 vs. 46 kg ha−1 for average of CC and C–SB) and a higher percentage of POM present as soil organic matter (17.1\% for the C–SB–SG–OCL sequence vs. 13.9\% for other sequences). Within the context of soil functions and cropping system performance, results from this study indicate the C–SB–SB–OCL sequence enhanced nutrient cycling efficiency, while N fertilization resulted in a trade-off between its positive effect on biological productivity and negative effect on nutrient cycling efficiency.},

We analyzed the impact on SOC of four N fertilization rates (0–270 kg N ha−1) and four cropping systems: continuous corn (CC) (Zea mays L.); corn–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (CS); corn–corn–oat–alfalfa (oat, Avena sativa L.; alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.) (CCOA), and corn–oat–alfalfa–alfalfa (COAA). Soils were sampled in 2002, Years 23 and 48 of the experiments located in northeast and north-central Iowa, respectively. The experiments were conducted using a replicated split-plot design under conventional tillage. A native prairie was sampled to provide a reference (for one site only). Cropping systems that contained alfalfa had the highest SOC stocks, whereas the CS system generally had the lowest SOC stocks. Concentrations of SOC increased significantly between 1990 and 2002 in only two of the nine systems for which historical data were available, the fertilized CC and COAA systems at one site. Soil quality indices such as particulate organic carbon (POC) were influenced by cropping system, with CS {\textless} CC {\textless} CCOA. In the native prairie, SOC, POC, and resistant C concentrations were 2.8, 2.6, and 3.9 times, respectively, the highest values in cropped soil, indicating that cultivated soils had not recovered to precultivation conditions. Although corn yields increased with N additions, N fertilization increased SOC stocks only in the CC system at one site. Considering the C cost for N fertilizer production, N fertilization generally had a net negative effect on C sequestration.},

	abstract = {Conversions of Mollisols from prairie to cropland and subsequent changes in crop production practices in the Midwestern USA have resulted in changes in soil organic matter. Few studies have used archived samples, long-term resampling of soils to a depth of 1 m, and space for time studies to document these changes. We resampled soils by depth (0–100 cm) in fields at 19 locations in central Illinois on poorly drained Mollisols that were in corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) rotations, were tile drained, and had no known history of manure application in recent decades. Three fields were paired with virgin prairie remnants, two had grass borders that were sampled, and 16 had been previously sampled in 1901 to 1904 or 1957 under various land uses (virgin prairie, cultivation, grass cover). The soils had large amounts of C and N in the profile, with mean values of 179 Mg C ha−1 and 16.1 Mg N ha−1 for the 18 cultivated fields sampled in 2001 and 2002. We confirmed a large reduction in organic C and total N pools from conversion of prairies to annual cultivation and artificial drainage and documented no change in these organic matter pools of cultivated soils during the period of synthetic fertilizer use (1957–2002). Cultivated fields had soil C and N concentrations typically 30 to 50\% less than virgin prairie soils. Smaller but significant declines in C and N concentrations were found when comparing 1900s cultivated fields to concentrations in 2002, after another 100 yr of cultivation, and in comparing 1957 grass covered fields that had been converted to annual cultivation before 2002. The reduction in organic matter after cultivation of prairies occurred mostly in the top 50 cm of soil, with evidence of translocation of C and N from these upper layers to the 50- to 100-cm depth, possibly enhanced by tile drainage. For these Mollisols, declines in organic matter were likely completed by the 1950s, with organic matter pools in a steady state under the production practices in place from the late 1950s through 2002.},

	abstract = {Intensive use of N fertilizers in modern agriculture is motivated by the economic value of high grain yields and is generally perceived to sequester soil organic C by increasing the input of crop residues. This perception is at odds with a century of soil organic C data reported herein for the Morrow Plots, the world's oldest experimental site under continuous corn (Zea mays L.). After 40 to 50 yr of synthetic fertilization that exceeded grain N removal by 60 to 190\%, a net decline occurred in soil C despite increasingly massive residue C incorporation, the decline being more extensive for a corn-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) or corn-oats (Avena sativa L.)-hay rotation than for continuous corn and of greater intensity for the profile (0-46 cm) than the surface soil. These findings implicate fertilizer N in promoting the decomposition of crop residues and soil organic matter and are consistent with data from numerous cropping experiments involving synthetic N fertilization in the USA Corn Belt and elsewhere, although not with the interpretation usually provided. There are important implications for soil C sequestration because the yield-based input of fertilizer N has commonly exceeded grain N removal for corn production on fertile soils since the 1960s. To mitigate the ongoing consequences of soil deterioration, atmospheric CO(2) enrichment, and NO(3)(-) pollution of ground and surface waters, N fertilization should be managed by site-specific assessment of soil N availability. Current fertilizer N management practices, if combined with corn stover removal for bioenergy production, exacerbate soil C loss.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen fertilization is critical to optimize short-term crop yield, but its long-term effect on soil organic C (SOC) is uncertain. Here, we clarify the impact of N fertilization on SOC in typical maize-based (Zea mays L.) Midwest U.S. cropping systems by accounting for site-to-site variability in maize yield response to N fertilization. Within continuous maize and maize-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] systems at four Iowa locations, we evaluated changes in surface SOC over 14 to 16 years across a range of N fertilizer rates empirically determined to be insufficient, optimum, or excessive for maximum maize yield. Soil organic C balances were negative where no N was applied but neutral (maize-soybean) or positive (continuous maize) at the agronomic optimum N rate (AONR). For continuous maize, the rate of SOC storage increased with increasing N rate, reaching a maximum at the AONR and decreasing above the AONR. Greater SOC storage in the optimally fertilized continuous maize system than in the optimally fertilized maize-soybean system was attributed to greater crop residue production and greater SOC storage efficiency in the continuous maize system. Mean annual crop residue production at the AONR was 22\% greater in the continuous maize system than in the maize-soybean system and the rate of SOC storage per unit residue C input was 58\% greater in the monocrop system. Our results demonstrate that agronomic optimum N fertilization is critical to maintain or increase SOC of Midwest U.S. cropland.},

Recent reports note the futility of addressing mitigation goals without fully engaging the agricultural sector, yet no available assessments combine both nature-based solutions (reforestation, grassland and wetland protection, and agricultural practice change) and cellulosic bioenergy for a single geographic region. Collectively, these solutions might offer a suite of climate, biodiversity, and other benefits greater than either alone. Nature-based solutions are largely constrained by the duration of carbon accrual in soils and forest biomass; each of these carbon pools will eventually saturate. Bioenergy solutions can last indefinitely but carry significant environmental risk if carelessly deployed. We detail a simplified scenario for the United States that illustrates the benefits of combining approaches. We assign a portion of non-forested former cropland to bioenergy sufficient to meet projected mid-century transportation needs, with the remainder assigned to nature-based solutions such as reforestation. Bottom-up mitigation potentials for the aggregate contributions of crop, grazing, forest, and bioenergy lands are assessed by including in a Monte Carlo model conservative ranges for cost-effective local mitigation capacities, together with ranges for (a) areal extents that avoid double counting and include realistic adoption rates and (b) the projected duration of different carbon sinks. The projected duration illustrates the net effect of eventually saturating soil carbon pools in the case of most strategies, and additionally saturating biomass carbon pools in the case of forest management. Results show a conservative end-of-century mitigation capacity of 110 (57–178) Gt CO2e for the U.S., 50\% higher than existing estimates that prioritize nature-based or bioenergy solutions separately. Further research is needed to shrink uncertainties, but there is sufficient confidence in the general magnitude and direction of a combined approach to plan for deployment now.},

	abstract = {Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production from lipids is a technologically mature approach for replacing conventional fossil fuel use in the aviation sector, and there is increasing demand for such feedstocks. The oilseed Brassica carinata (known as Ethiopian mustard or simply carinata) is a promising SAF feedstock that can be grown as a supplemental cash crop over the winter fallow season of various annual crop rotations in the Southeast US, avoiding land use changes and potentially achieving some of the soil carbon sequestration and ecosystem service benefits of winter cover crops. However, carinata may require more intensive management than traditional cover crops, potentially leading to additional soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through increased carbon losses from soil tillage and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from nitrogen fertilizer application. In this work, the 2017 version of the process-based DayCent ecosystem model was used to establish initial expectations for the total regional SAF production potential and associated soil GHG emissions when carinata is integrated as a winter crop into the existing crop rotations across its current suitability range in southern Alabama, southern Georgia, and northern Florida. Using data from academic and industry carinata field trials in the region, DayCent was calibrated to reproduce carinata yield, nitrogen response, harvest index, and biomass carbon-to-nitrogen ratio. The resulting model was then used to simulate the integration of carinata every third winter across all 2.1 Mha of actively cultivated cropland in the study area. The model predicted regional average yields of 2.9–3.0 Mg carinata seed per hectare depending on crop management assumptions. That results in the production of more than two million Mg of carinata seed annually across the study area, enough to supply approximately one billion liters of SAF. Conventional management of carinata led to only modest increases in soil carbon storage that were largely offset by additional N2O emissions. Climate-smart management via adopting no-till carinata establishment or using poultry litter as a nitrogen source resulted in a substantial net soil GHG sink (0.23–0.31 Mg CO2e ha−1 y−1, or 0.24–0.32 Mg CO2e per Mg of seed produced) at the farms where carinata is cultivated.},

Because land is a basic source of mass and energy throughput in all terrestrial ecosystems, land use and cover represents an integrating element in ecological economics. We have developed a global model that captures this concept. We illustrate this concept's usefulness by showing how global changes in climate, human populations, and international trade policies might affect tropical forests. Results from our scenarios indicate that such changes would likely have adverse effects on the health and integrity of tropical forest ecosystems. Results from our scenarios also indicate that forest depletion in Southeast Asia can be correlated with numerous economic indicators. Whether the correlation with a particular economic variable is positive or negative depends on the global change scenario. This merely reflects the fact that interactions between economic and ecological phenomena are complex. Modeling capabilities can be expanded by adding economic and ecological detail, including more material on throughput, and developing methods for simulating dynamic analyses.},

The regional biomass supply for a 20 MW bioelectricity facility is estimated using the Land Use and Resource Allocation (LURA) model. Results from LURA and data on regional forest management, harvesting, and processing are incorporated into the GHGs, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Technologies (GREET) model for LCA. The results suggest that GHG emissions of mill residues-based pathways can be 15–52\% lower than those of pulpwood-based pathways, with logging residues falling in between. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that screening bioenergy projects on specific feedstock types alone is not sufficient because GHG emissions of a pulpwood-based pathway in one state can be lower than those of a mill residue-based pathway in another state. Furthermore, the available biomass supply often consists of several woody feedstocks, and its composition is region-dependent. Forest biomass-derived electricity is associated with 86–93\% lower life-cycle GHG emissions than the emissions of the average grid electricity in the U.S. Key factors driving bioelectricity GHG emissions include electricity generation efficiency, transportation distance, and energy use for biomass harvesting and processing.},

EPA projected that by 2022, the emissions profile of corn ethanol from a new refinery would be 21\% lower than that of an energy equivalent quantity of gasoline. Since 2010, the 21\% value has dominated policy discussions and federal regulations related to corn ethanol as a renewable fuel and a GHG mitigation option. It is now 2018 and new data, scientific studies, technical reports, and other information allow us to examine the emissions pathway corn-ethanol has actually followed since 2010. Using this information, we assess corn ethanol's current GHG profile at 39–43\% lower than gasoline. We also develop two projected emissions scenarios for corn ethanol in 2022. These scenarios highlight opportunities to produce ethanol with emissions that are 47.0–70.0\% lower than gasoline. Many countries are now developing or revising renewable energy policies. Typically, biofuel substitutes for gasoline are required to reduce GHG emissions by more than 21\%. Our results could help position U.S. corn ethanol to compete in these new and growing markets.},

In this study, we estimated the cost of carbon stored on an acre of afforested loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) over a 100-years simulation period in the Lower Coastal Plain Region of the Southern United States. We varied site indices, interest rates, and carbon discount rates for ascertaining the impacts on the cost of the total carbon stored across three carbon pools (stand, finished wood products, and wood present in landfills). After accounting for the net profits from an acre of afforested loblolly pine plantation, the cost of stored carbon currently ranges between \$0.76/ton and -\$10.12/ton over a 100-years simulation period with zero carbon discount rate. The cost of stored carbon is lower for higher site indices. The cost of stored carbon decreases with a rise in the carbon discount rate. Afforestation is a cost-effective nature-based solution for mitigating climate change. It should be considered as a potential strategy for reducing the overall cost of mitigating climate change in the United States. The findings of the study are relevant for efforts promoting afforestation as a tool for mitigating climate change worldwide.},

	abstract = {The use of propensity scores to control for pretreatment imbalances on observed variables in non-randomized or observational studies examining the causal effects of treatments or interventions has become widespread over the past decade. For settings with two conditions of interest such as a treatment and a control, inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation with propensity scores estimated via boosted models has been shown in simulation studies to yield causal effect estimates with desirable properties. There are tools (e.g., the twang package in R) and guidance for implementing this method with two treatments. However, there is not such guidance for analyses of three or more treatments. The goals of this paper are twofold: (1) to provide step-by-step guidance for researchers who want to implement propensity score weighting for multiple treatments and (2) to propose the use of generalized boosted models (GBM) for estimation of the necessary propensity score weights. We define the causal quantities that may be of interest to studies of multiple treatments and derive weighted estimators of those quantities. We present a detailed plan for using GBM to estimate propensity scores and using those scores to estimate weights and causal effects. We also provide tools for assessing balance and overlap of pretreatment variables among treatment groups in the context of multiple treatments.

To address these issues and their complex interdependency in a consistent modelling approach we adapted the agro-ecosystem model DayCent for the simulation of major crops at the global scale. Based on a global compilation of environmental and management data and an algorithm to calculate global planting dates, DayCent was parameterised and calibrated to simulate global yield levels for wheat, maize, rice and soybeans. Simulation results show that the DayCent model is able to reproduce the major effects of climate, soil and management on crop production. Average simulated crop yield per country agree well with agricultural statistics (Modelling efficiency is about 0.66 for wheat, rice and maize, and 0.32 for soybean) and spatial patterns of yields generally correspond to observed crop distributions and sub-national census data.},

	abstract = {Innovative, open, and rapid methods to map crop types over large areas are needed for long-term cropland monitoring. We developed two novel and automated decision tree classification approaches to map crop types across the conterminous United States (U.S.) using MODIS 250m resolution data: 1) generalized, and 2) year-specific classification. The classification approaches use similarities and dissimilarities in crop type phenology derived from NDVI time-series data for the two approaches. The year-specific approach uses the training samples from one year and classifies crop types for that year only, whereas the generalized classification approach uses above-average, average, and below-average precipitation years for training to produce crop type maps for one or multiple years more robustly. We produced annual crop type maps using the generalized classification approach for 2001–2014 and the year-specific approach for 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The year-specific classification had overall accuracies {\textgreater}78\%, while the generalized classifier had accuracies {\textgreater}75\% for the conterminous U.S. for 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012. The generalized classifier enables automated and routine crop type mapping without repeated and expensive ground sample collection year after year. The resulting crop type maps for years prior to 2007 are new and especially important for long-term cropland monitoring and food security analysis because no other map products are currently available for 2001–2007.},

	abstract = {Landsat Thematic Mapper has been collecting multispectral imagery at 30 m resolution globally since 1984. One utility of the data has been for detailed mapping of agricultural regions and seasonal identification of crops grown within them. However, the ability to do so has only been applied sporadically and eluded widespread adoption due to cost of the imagery, burdensome preprocessing requirements, and computing not being up to the task. These hurdles have become much reduced of recent with the free and open distribution of the Landsat imagery, emphasis on ready-to-use surface reflectance data products, and distributed high performance computing infrastructures available online in “the cloud.” As such, this work leverages these aspects and investigates the ability to retrospectively map summer crops over the United States (US) annually from 1984 to 2007. Google's Earth Engine Internet-based analytical platform containing the historical Landsat archive in surface reflectance format was used as a foundation for the classification work. Robust 30 m Cropland Data Layer (CDL) information from US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for years 2008 through 2011 were leveraged to train rule-based classifiers which were applied back through time to each year 1984 through 2007. Focus crops were corn, soybeans, and winter wheat – the three largest by area in the US. A large sampling of highly intensive counties throughout the country were prototyped for generation of the 24 years of historical crop cover. For validation, crop area statistics were calculated for each county-year and compared to survey-based information existing from the USDA. Results were muted overall with the average crop area coefficient of determination (R2) correlations for the years 1984–2007 found to be 0.192, 0.159, and 0.142 for corn, soybeans, and winter wheat, respectively. Furthermore, the standard deviations were variable at 0.132, 0.177, and 0.133, also respectively. While unimpressive, it was found as a benchmark that the R2 between the 2008 through 2017 CDL classifications were only 0.478, 0.686, and 0.726 and thus a suggestion that the USDA area statistics are an imperfect measure of map accuracy. Deletion of approximately one third to one half of the grossest 1984–2007 outlier years from the historical outputs pulled the correlations to the benchmark standard. Qualitatively, most of the remaining years classified looked of high quality and were believed useful as field-level thematic crop area maps. These historical cropland maps could provide the ability to better detail the role farming has played on the broad US landscape over recent decades.},

	abstract = {Long-term soil carbon (C) dynamics in agro-ecosystems is controlled by interactions of climate, soil and agronomic management. A modeling approach is a useful tool to understand the interactions, especially over long climatic sequences. In this paper, we examine the performance of the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to predict the long-term soil C dynamics under various agricultural practices at four semi-arid sites across the wheat-belt of eastern Australia. We further assessed the underlying factors that regulate soil C dynamics in the top 30cm of soil through scenario analysis using the validated model. The results show that APSIM is able to predict aboveground biomass production and soil C dynamics at the study sites. Scenario analyses indicate that nitrogen (N) fertilization combined with residue retention (SR) has the potential to significantly slow or reverse the loss of C from agricultural soils. Optimal N fertilization (Nopt) and 100\% SR, increased soil C by 13\%, 46\% and 45\% at Warra, Wagga Wagga and Tarelee, respectively. Continuous lucerne pasture was the most efficient strategy to accumulate soil C, resulting in increases of 49\%, 57\% and 50\% at Warra, Wagga Wagga and Tarlee, respectively. In contrast, soil C decreases regardless of agricultural practices as a result of cultivation of natural soils at the Brigalow site. Soil C input, proportional to the amount of retained residue, is a significant predictor of soil C change. At each site, water and nitrogen availability and their interaction, explain more than 59\% of the variation in soil C. Across the four sites, mean air temperature has significant (P{\textless}0.05) effects on soil C change. There was greater soil C loss at sites with higher temperature. Our simulations suggest that detailed information on agricultural practices, land use history and local environmental conditions must be explicitly specified to be able to make plausible predictions of the soil C balance in agro-ecosystems at different agro-ecological scales.},

	abstract = {Conversion of native vegetation to cropland and intensification of agriculture typically result in increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (mainly N2O and CH4) and more NO3 leached below the root zone and into waterways. Agricultural soils are often a source but can also be a sink of CO2. Regional and larger scale estimates of GHG emissions are usually obtained using IPCC emission factor methodology, which is associated with high uncertainty. To more realistically represent GHG emissions we used the DAYCENT biogeochemical model for non-rice major crop types (corn, wheat, soybean). IPCC methodology estimates N losses from croplands based solely on N inputs. In contrast, DAYCENT accounts for soil class, daily weather, historical vegetation cover, and land management practices such as crop type, fertilizer additions, and cultivation events. Global datasets of weather, soils, native vegetation, and cropping fractions were mapped to a 1.9°×1.9° resolution. Non-spatial data (e.g., rates and dates of fertilizer applications) were assumed to be identical within crop types across regions. We compared model generated baseline GHG emissions and N losses for irrigated and rainfed cropping with land management alternatives intended to mitigate GHG emissions. Reduced fertilizer resulted in lower N losses, but crop yields were reduced by a similar proportion. Use of nitrification inhibitors and split fertilizer applications both led to increased ({\textasciitilde}6\%) crop yields but the inhibitor led to a larger reduction in N losses ({\textasciitilde}10\%). No-till cultivation, which led to C storage, combined with nitrification inhibitors, resulted in reduced GHG emissions of {\textasciitilde}50\% and increased crop yields of {\textasciitilde}7\%.},

	abstract = {Randomized clinical trials (RCT) are accepted as the gold-standard approaches to measure effects of intervention or treatment on outcomes. They are also the designs of choice for health technology assessment (HTA). Randomization ensures comparability, in both measured and unmeasured pretreatment characteristics, of individuals assigned to treatment and control or comparator. However, even adequately powered RCTs are not always feasible for several reasons such as cost, time, practical and ethical constraints, and limited generalizability. RCTs rely on data collected on selected, homogeneous population under highly controlled conditions; hence, they provide evidence on efficacy of interventions rather than on effectiveness. Alternatively, observational studies can provide evidence on the relative effectiveness or safety of a health technology compared to one or more alternatives when provided under the setting of routine health care practice. In observational studies, however, treatment assignment is a non-random process based on an individual’s baseline characteristics; hence, treatment groups may not be comparable in their pretreatment characteristics. As a result, direct comparison of outcomes between treatment groups might lead to biased estimate of the treatment effect. Propensity score approaches have been used to achieve balance or comparability of treatment groups in terms of their measured pretreatment covariates thereby controlling for confounding bias in estimating treatment effects. Despite the popularity of propensity scores methods and recent important methodological advances, misunderstandings on their applications and limitations are all too common. In this article, we present a review of the propensity scores methods, extended applications, recent advances, and their strengths and limitations.},

We present the results of an automated system used across 645 counties in the United States Corn Belt from 2005 to 2018, mapped at field-scale and summarized for distribution at aggregated scales. Large-scale mapping by OpTIS (Operational Tillage Information System), a software tool that analyzes remotely sensed data of agricultural land, provides trends of conservation tillage (defined as {\textgreater}30\% residue cover), cover cropping, and crop rotations, while modeling by DNDC (Denitrification–Decomposition), a process-based model of carbon and biogeochemistry in soil, provides estimates of the ecosystem outcomes associated with the changes in management practices mapped by OpTIS. Ground-truthing data acquired via OpTIS mobile, a roadside field-surveying app, were used for verification in 30 counties. OpTIS results for the Corn Belt show adoption of cover crops after planting corn and soy increased from 1\% to 3\% of the mapped area when comparing 2006 to 2018. Comparison of trends for conservation tillage use from 2006 to 2018 shows a slight decrease in conservation tillage adoption, from 46\% to 44\%. Results from DNDC show these soils sequestered soil organic carbon (SOC) at an area-weighted mean change in SOC (dSOC) rate of 161 kgC/ha/year. Comparatively, in a scenario modeled without the adoption of soil health management practices, the same soils would have lost SOC at an area-weighted rate of −65 kgC/ha/year. As many factors affect changes to SOC, including climate and initial SOC in soils, modeling counterfactual scenarios at the field scale demonstrates outcomes of current soil health management in comparison to regional management practices and best management practices, with respect to SOC sequestration. Regional trends in adoption rates of conservation agriculture and resulting soil health implications are of great use for a wide range of stakeholders. We demonstrate the capability of OpTIS remote sensing to deliver robust, large-scale, multi-sensor, ground-verified monitoring data of current and historical adoption of conservation practices, and of DNDC process-based modeling to provide assessments of the associated environmental outcomes across regions in U.S. cropland.},

This article estimates the effects of conservation tillage on county average corn and soybean yields using remotely-sensed tillage practice adoption data in 646 counties across 12 Corn Belt states from 2005 to 2018. Exploiting deviations from county-specific means in the data, we find no evidence that conservation tillage negatively affects corn or soybean yields. We also find that it can mitigate the impact of drought on soybean yields. We explore how wider use of conservation tillage might offset the increase in drought-induced downside risk to soybean yields under climate change projections from five global climate models.},

	abstract = {In the face of climate change and more frequent extreme weather, increasing crop resilience to weather anomaly has become a critical issue. This study explores the relationship between conservation practices (cover crop, no-tillage) and the resilience of corn and soybean to extreme precipitation, based on county-level data from the U.S. Corn Belt from 2005 to 2018. Crop insurance indemnities reflect crop losses and therefore reflect crop resilience. The research constructs three county- and year-fixed-effect regression models. Regression results show that as the degrees of weather extremes increases, the crop indemnities increase in general. When the interaction of extreme weather and conservation practices is taken into consideration, the relationships between conservation practices and indemnity level are not consistent, and they are based on the degree of weather anomaly. Corn cover crop acres are negatively correlated with the corn indemnity regardless of the precipitation level, and the soybean no-tillage acres are positively correlated with the soybean indemnity regardless of the precipitation level. However, for the corn no-tillage practices and the soybean cover crop practices, only when the precipitation is close to an average level do they negatively correlate with their corresponding crop indemnity levels. The capacity and resilience cultivation effect of conservation practices may vary across different crops and practices.},

	abstract = {Growing cover or winter crops and retaining crop residue on agricultural lands are considered beneficial management practices to address soil health and water quality. Remote sensing is a valuable tool to assess and map crop residue cover and cover crops. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of linear spectral unmixing for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season (November–May) over the Canadian Lake Erie Basin using seasonal multitemporal satellite imagery. Soil cover ground measurements and multispectral Landsat-8 imagery were acquired for two areas throughout the 2015–2016 non-growing season. Vertical soil cover photos were collected from up to 40 residue and 30 cover crop fields for each area (e.g., Elgin and Essex sites) when harvest, cloud, and snow conditions permitted. Images and data were reviewed and compiled to represent a complete coverage of the basin for three time periods (post-harvest, pre-planting, and post-planting). The correlations between field measured and satellite imagery estimated soil covers (e.g., residue and green) were evaluated by coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Overall, spectral unmixing of satellite imagery is well suited for estimating soil cover in the non-growing season. Spectral unmixing using three-endmembers (i.e., corn residue-soil-green cover; soybean residue-soil-green cover) showed higher correlations with field measured soil cover than spectral unmixing using two- or four-endmembers. For the nine non-growing season images analyzed, the residue and green cover fractions derived from linear spectral unmixing using corn residue-soil-green cover endmembers were highly correlated with the field-measured data (mean R2 of 0.70 and 0.86, respectively). The results of this study support the use of remote sensing and spectral unmixing techniques for monitoring performance metrics for government initiatives, such as the Canada-Ontario Lake Erie Action Plan, and as input for sustainability indicators that both require knowledge about non-growing season land management over a large area.},

	abstract = {Sustainable agricultural practices are becoming more important as concerns over climate change increases. Climate change brings with it the concern of decreasing yields from increasing drought frequency and weather variability. One practice that may help reduce the impact of climate change and currently receiving increased attention is cover crops. They are well regarded in their ability to provide current and future benefits to the farmer and the nearby ecosystem. As a result, some states have been actively working on encouraging their use. However, the existence of stringent cover crop initiation and termination rules needed to remain eligible for crop insurance coverage means that farmers may avoid the risk of losing their coverage by avoiding the use of cover crops. Moral hazard may also be involved in reducing the use of such and other sustainable agricultural practices. In this study, we investigate whether such a link between cover crop use and crop insurance participation exists. We use an exogenous policy shock, the passage of the 2008 Farm Bill, as an instrument for crop insurance participation. We find that indeed a negative link exists between the use of cover crops and the amount of crop insurance purchased by farmers.},

	abstract = {Climate change is exacerbating environmental pollution from crop production. Spatially and temporally explicit estimates of life-cycle environmental impacts are therefore needed for suggesting location and time relevant environmental mitigations strategies. Emission factors and process-based mechanism models are popular approaches used to estimate life-cycle environmental impacts. However, emission factors are often incapable of describing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of agricultural emissions, whereas process-based mechanistic models, capable of capturing the heterogeneity, tend to be very complicated and time-consuming. Efficient prediction of life-cycle environmental impacts from agricultural production is lacking. This study develops a rapid predictive model to quantify life-cycle global warming (GW) and eutrophication (EU) impacts of corn production using a novel machine learning approach. We used the boosted regression tree (BRT) model to estimate future life-cycle environmental impacts of corn production in U.S. Midwest counties under four emissions scenarios for years 2022–2100. Results from BRT models indicate that the cross-validation (R2) for predicting life cycle GW and EU impacts ranged from 0.78 to 0.82, respectively. Furthermore, results show that future life-cycle GW and EU impacts of corn production will increase in magnitude under all four emissions scenarios, with the highest environmental impacts shown under the high-emissions scenario. Moreover, this study found that changes in precipitation and temperature played a significant role in influencing the spatial heterogeneity in all life-cycle impacts across Midwest counties. The BRT model results indicate that machine learning can be a useful tool for predicting spatially and temporally explicit future life-cycle environmental impacts associated with corn production under different climate scenarios.},

	abstract = {To explore how well large spatial scale digital soil mapping can contribute to efforts to monitor soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and changes, we reviewed regional and national studies quantifying SOC within lands dominated by agriculture using SCORPAN approaches that rely on soil (S), climate (C), organisms (O), relief (R), parent material (P), age (A), and space (N) covariates representing soil forming factors. After identifying 79 regional ({\textgreater} 10,000 km2) and national studies that attempted to estimate SOC, we evaluated model performances with reference to soil sampling depth, number of predictors, grid-distance, and spatial extent. SCORPAN covariates were then investigated in terms of their frequency of use and data sources. Lastly, we used 67 studies encompassing a variety of spatial scales to determine which covariates most inﬂuenced SOC in agricultural lands using a subjective ranking system. Topography (used in 94\% of the cases), climate (87\%), and organisms (86\%) covariates that were the most frequently used SCORPAN predictors, aligned with the factors (precipitation, temperature, elevation, slope, vegetation indices, and land use) currently identiﬁed to be most inﬂuential for model estimate at the large spatial extent. Models generally succeeded in estimating SOC with ﬁts represented by R2 with a median value of 0.47 but, performance varied widely (R2 between 0.02 and 0.86) among studies. Predictive success declined signiﬁcantly with increased soil sampling depth (p {\textless} 0.001) and spatial extent (p {\textless} 0.001) due to increased variability. While studies have extensively drawn on large-scale surveys and remote sensing databases to estimate environmental covariates, the absence of soils data needed to understand the inﬂuence of management or temporal change limits our ability to make useful inferences about changes in SOC stocks at this scale. This review suggests digital soil mapping efforts can be improved through greater use of data representing soil type and parent material and consideration of spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC occurring within different depths and land use or management systems.},

The first approach entailed grouping data from a global pedon SOC database by type of ecosystem, resulting in a total of 78.0 Pg of C (Pg = 1015 g) to 1-m depth for the contiguous USA. In a second approach, a pedon database was aggregated using soil taxonomy, resulting in a total for the contiguous USA of 80.7 ± 18.6 Pg of C when the great group SOC was spatially distributed with Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) using the 1982 National Resource Inventory (NRI) and the Soil Interpretation Record databases. The third approach used pedon and spatial data from a global soil map grouped by soil unit that resulted in 84.5 Pg of C for the contiguous USA. Although the ecosystem and soil taxonomic approaches resulted in similar totals, the taxonomic approaches are recommended because they gave more realistic results in areas of Histosols, shallow soils, and soils with high rock fragment content. The ecosystem approach did not give reliable spatial patterns and is only useful for very broad-scale work where precisely georeferenced data are not needed. Grouping data by great group provided more information than grouping by order or suborder. The approach based on soil taxonomy is very useful because it is based on the NRI statistical framework and it allows stratification by other NRI items, such as land use and vegetation.},

Theoretical analysis of two complementary economic models demonstrates that the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) typically reported by these studies can be related to an economic measure of program performance only under very restrictive conditions. This is because the ATT is usually expressed in purely physical terms (e.g., avoided deforestation) and ignores heterogeneity in the costs and benefits of conservation programs. For the same reasons, clinical trials are a misleading analogy for the evaluation of conservation programs. To be more useful for economic analyses of conservation programs, impact evaluations should work toward developing measures of program outcomes that are economically more relevant, data that would enable the evaluation of impacts on forest degradation (not just deforestation) and primary forests (not forests in general), better estimates of spatially disaggregated treatment effects (not program-wide averages), and better information on the accuracy of estimated treatment effects as predictors of future risks.},

original concept to the design and evaluation of scalable policy. We do so by evaluating a series of strategies that aim to integrate the nongovernment organization Pratham's "Teaching at the 
Right Level" methodology into elementary schools in India. The methodology consists of reorganizing instruction based on children's actual learning levels, rather than on a prescribed syllabus, 
and has previously been shown to be very effective when properly implemented. We present evidence from randomized controlled trials involving some designs that failed to produce impacts 
within the regular schooling system but still helped shape subsequent versions of the program. As a result of this process, two versions of the programs were developed that successfully raised 
children's learning levels using scalable models in government schools. We use this example to draw general lessons about using randomized control trials to design scalable policies.},

The paper's larger argument is that greater application of experimental and quasi-experimental techniques can identify efficient policies that increase social welfare.},

	abstract = {Iron deficiency anemia is frequent among the poor worldwide. While it can be prevented with the appropriate supplement or food fortification, these programs struggle to reach the poorest, out-of-school children, men and the elderly. This paper reports on the impact of a potential strategy to address iron deficiency anemia in rural areas: salt fortified with iron and iodine (DFS). We conduct a large-scale experiment in 400 villages in Bihar to test the impacts of both selling DFS and giving it away for free. At baseline, 45\% of the sample is anemic. In 200 randomly assigned villages, we introduce DFS for the first time at half the normal retail price and sell it for roughly 30 months. In 62 of those sales villages, we deliver DFS for free directly to 7 randomly assigned households over nearly 24 months. We find no evidence that either selling DFS or providing it for free has an economically meaningful or statistically significant impact on hemoglobin, anemia, physical health, cognition or mental health. For the sales experiment, we can reject a reduction of 2.4 percent in the fraction anemic in the entire sample and 1 percent among those who were previously anemic. Using an IV strategy, we find a statistically significant, though relatively small, increase in hemoglobin and reduction in the fraction anemic for adolescents, a subgroup that responded well to supplements and fortification in earlier studies. These disappointing results are explained both by modest purchases and low impact of DFS for the majority of the population, even when consumed somewhat regularly.},

	abstract = {In the evaluation of public programs, experimental designs are rare. Researchers instead rely on observational designs. Observational designs that use panel data are widely portrayed as superior to time-series or cross-sectional designs because they provide opportunities to control for observable and unobservable variables correlated with outcomes and exposure to a program. The most popular panel data evaluation designs use linear, fixed-effects estimators with additive individual and time effects. To assess the ability of observational designs to replicate results from experimental designs, scholars use design replications. No such replications have assessed popular, fixed-effects panel data models that exploit repeated observations before and after treatment assignment. We implement such a study using, as a benchmark, results from a randomized environmental program that included effective and ineffective treatments. The popular linear, fixed-effects estimator fails to generate impact estimates or statistical inferences similar to the experimental estimator. Applying common flexible model specifications or trimming procedures also fail to yield accurate estimates or inferences. However, following best practices for selecting a nonexperimental comparison group and combining matching methods with panel data estimators, we replicate the experimental benchmarks. We demonstrate how the combination of panel and matching methods mitigates common concerns about specifying the correct functional form, the nature of treatment effect heterogeneity, and the way in which time enters the model. Our results are consistent with recent claims that design trumps methods in estimating treatment effects and that combining designs is more likely to approximate a randomized controlled trial than applying a single design.},

The observed production response and deforestation increase are larger in communities with poor road infrastructure.

In its basic version, a “control group” is untreated at two dates, whereas a “treatment group” becomes fully treated at the second date. However, in many applications of the DID method, the treatment rate only increases more in the treatment group. In such fuzzy designs, a popular estimator of the treatment effect is the DID of the outcome divided by the DID of the treatment. We show that this ratio identifies a local average treatment effect only if the effect of the treatment is stable over time, and if the effect of the treatment is the same in the treatment and in the control group. We then propose two alternative estimands that do not rely on any assumption on treatment effects, and that can be used when the treatment rate does not change over time in the control group. We prove that the corresponding estimators are asymptotically normal. Finally, we use our results to reassess the returns to schooling in Indonesia.},

We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference.

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups.

In this paper, we focus on staggered DID (also referred as event studies) and discuss the role played by the PTA in terms of identification and estimation of causal parameters. We document a “robustness” versus “efficiency” trade-off in terms of the strength of the underlying PTA and argue that practitioners should be explicit about these trade-offs whenever using DID procedures. We propose new DID estimators that reflect these trade-offs and derive their large sample properties.

	abstract = {Uncertainty was quantified for an inventory estimating change in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage resulting from modifications in land use and management across US agricultural lands between 1982 and 1997. This inventory was conducted using a modified version of a carbon (C) accounting method developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Probability density functions (PDFs) were derived for each input to the IPCC model, including reference SOC stocks, land use/management activity data, and management factors. Change in C storage was estimated using a Monte-Carlo approach with 50 000 iterations, by randomly selecting values from the PDFs after accounting for dependencies in the model inputs. Over the inventory period, mineral soils had a net gain of 10.8 Tg C yr−1, with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from 6.5 to 15.3 Tg C yr−1. Most of this gain was due to setting-aside lands in the Conservation Reserve Program. In contrast, managed organic soils lost 9.4 Tg C yr−1, with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from 6.4 to 13.3 Tg C yr−1. Combining these gains and losses in SOC, US agricultural soils accrued 1.3 Tg C yr−1 due to land use and management change, with a 95\% confidence interval ranging from a loss of 4.4 Tg C yr−1 to a gain of 6.9 Tg C yr−1. Most of the uncertainty was attributed to management factors for tillage, land use change between cultivated and uncultivated conditions, and C loss rates from managed organic soils. Based on the uncertainty, we are not able to conclude with 95\% confidence that change in US agricultural land use and management between 1982 and 1997 created a net C sink for atmospheric CO2.},

	abstract = {Researchers have increasingly realized the need to account for within-group dependence in estimating standard errors of regression parameter estimates. The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (5-30) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of ten percent using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of five percent using our methods.},

	abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

In addition to environmental and ecological factors, angler choices may influence recreational catches. Using interviews (92,838) from Walleye Sander vitreus anglers in Lake Erie during 1989–2017, we identified how angler behavior influences catch outcomes. Angler behaviors were associated with changes in catch rate and the length of harvested fish. For example, trolling resulted in a 50\% increase in median catch and a 24-mm increase in length, relative to casting. Other behaviors led to tradeoffs between catch rate and size, such as the time of year anglers fished. We identified behaviors that maximize fishing success with respect to anglers’ desired catch outcomes. Our results can help increase angler satisfaction by providing realistic catch expectations, given the environmental and fishery conditions, while improving recreational catch outcomes through more informed angler decision making.},

Quantifying these relationships can be complicated, if their effects vary spatially over a population’s range or are non-additive (i.e., interactive), where one factor mediates the effect of another. Toward understanding the relative influence of demographic and environmental factors on fishery harvest in large freshwater lakes, we used varying-coefficient generalized additive models to explore the existence of non-additive, spatially-dependent effects of adult population size and thermal conditions on recreational harvest patterns of Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus) during 2006-2015. We identified nonlinear, additive, and generally positive effects of thermal conditions and adult population size on harvest rates. Their effects were, however, spatially-dependent, the accounting of which can help explain inter-annual and intra-annual variation in lake-wide harvest rates. Specifically, harvest rates increased more with increasing cumulative degree days in the eastern portion of the central basin, especially offshore, relative to the rest of the study area. Harvest rates also increased more with increasing walleye population size in the southwest portion of the west basin and the middle of the central basin compared to other study areas. As in marine ecosystems, our findings demonstrate the benefit of using modeling approaches that consider the spatial dependency of harvest rate on demographic and environmental factors to understanding broader harvest dynamics in large lakes. Their use could help managers and policy-makers ensure the sustained use of valued freshwater fish populations amidst demographic and environmental change.},

	abstract = {Understanding environmental driver-response relationships is critical to the implementation of effective ecosystem-based management. Ecosystems are often influenced by multiple drivers that operate on different timescales and may be nonstationary. In turn, contrasting views of ecosystem state and structure could arise depending on the temporal perspective of analysis. Further, assessment of multiple ecosystem components (e.g., biological indicators) may serve to identify different key drivers and connections. To explore how the timescale of analysis and data richness can influence the identification of driver-response relationships within a large, dynamic ecosystem, this study analyzed long-term (1969–2018) data from Lake Erie (USA–Canada). Data were compiled on multiple biological, physical, chemical, and socioeconomic components of the ecosystem to quantify trends and identify potential key drivers during multiple time intervals (20 to 50 years duration), using zooplankton, bird, and fish community metrics as indicators of ecosystem change. Concurrent temporal shifts of many variables occurred during the 1980s, but asynchronous dynamics were evident among indicator taxa. The strengths and rank orders of predictive drivers shifted among intervals and were sometimes taxon-specific. Drivers related to nutrient loading and lake trophic status were consistently strong predictors of temporal patterns for all indicators; however, within the longer intervals, measures of agricultural land use were the strongest predictors, whereas within shorter intervals, the stronger predictors were measures of tributary or in-lake nutrient concentrations. Physical drivers also tended to increase in predictive ability within shorter intervals. The results highlight how the time interval examined can filter influences of lower-frequency, slower drivers and higher-frequency, faster drivers. Understanding ecosystem change in support of ecosystem-based management requires consideration of both the temporal perspective of analysis and the chosen indicators, as both can influence which drivers are identified as most predictive of ecosystem trends at that timescale.},

We provide key information on the benefits of harmful algal bloom cleanup by linking housing transactions in 2003 to 2015 from seven Ohio counties bordering Lake Erie with measures of water quality using remote-sensing images. We further control for endogenous algae production using instrumental variables derived from hydrological processes that link Maumee River runoff to nutrient concentrations in Lake Erie. Using a semiparametric approach, we find the impact of harmful algal blooms on housing prices is spatially limited to properties within 1.2 km of Lake Erie. For the average near lake homeowner, a 1 μg/L increase in algae concentrations is expected to decrease property values by 1.7\% (\$2205).

The inconsistent impact of cover crops on total P loss was related to cover crop effects on sediment loss. Although cover crop impacts on total P losses were inconsistent, the addition of a cover crop increased DRP loss in three of four years. Cover crop use consistently reduced sediment loss, with greater sediment reduction when P fertilizer was applied.

              Manure application to agricultural soils is widely considered as a source of nutrients and a method of maintaining levels of soil organic carbon (SOC) to mitigate climate change. At present, it is still unclear which factors are responsible for the SOC stock dynamics. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between SOC stock changes and site characteristics, soil properties, experiment characteristics and manure characteristics. Overall, we included 101 studies with a total of 592 treatments. On average, the application of manure on agricultural soils increased SOC stocks by 35.4\%, corresponding to 10.7 Mg ha
              −1
              . Manure applications in conventional tillage systems led to higher SOC stocks (+ 2.2 Mg ha
              −1
              ) than applications under reduced tillage. Soil organic carbon increase upon manure application was higher in soils under non-tropical climate conditions (+ 2.7 Mg ha
              −1
              ) compared to soils under sub-tropical climate. Larger SOC increases after manure application were achieved in intermediate and shallow topsoils (in 0–15 cm by 9.5 Mg ha
              −1
              and in 16–20 cm by 13.6 Mg ha
              −1
              ), but SOC stocks were also increased in deeper soils ({\textgreater} 20 cm 4.6 Mg ha
              −1
              ), regardless of the tillage intensity. The highest relative SOC increase (+ 48\%) was achieved if the initial SOC was below 1\% but the absolute SOC increased with increasing initial SOC. Clay soils showed higher SOC increase rates compared to sandy soils (+ 3.1 Mg ha
              −1
              ). Acidic soils showed comparable relative effects but a higher stock difference than neutral (+ 5.1 Mg ha
              −1
              ) and alkaline soils (+ 5.1 Mg ha
              −1
              ). The application of farmyard-, cattle- and pig manure showed the highest SOC increases (50\%, 32\% and 41\%, respectively), while green manure and straw showed only minor effects. If manure applications were combined with additional mineral fertilizer, the SOC increases were higher (+ 1.7 Mg ha
              −1
              ) compared to manure alone. Higher applied amounts generally led to higher SOC stocks. However the annually applied amount is only important under conventional tillage, non-tropical climate conditions, and pH-neutral as well as SOC-rich or SOC-depleted soils and if no additional mineral fertilization is applied. Further studies should focus on the SOC dynamics under tropical climate conditions and factors influencing a potential carbon saturation. In both cases, the number of data was too small. For this reason, additional field studies should be conducted primarily in the tropics. On the other hand, long-term field trials should be re-assessed or newly established to specifically investigate potential saturation effects and long-term ({\textgreater} 20 years) fertilizer effects and carbon sequestration.},

              Cropland soil organic carbon (SOC) is undergoing substantial alterations due to both environmental and anthropogenic changes. Although numerous case studies have been conducted, there remains a lack of quantification of the consequences of such environmental and anthropogenic changes on the SOC sequestration across global agricultural systems. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of SOC changes under different fertilizer managements, namely unbalanced application of chemical fertilizers (UCF), balanced application of chemical fertilizers (CF), chemical fertilizers with straw application (CFS), and chemical fertilizers with manure application (CFM). We show that topsoil organic carbon (C) increased by 0.9 (0.7–1.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI)) g kg

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient to boost crop yields, but P runoff can cause nutrient over-enrichment in agricultural watersheds and can lead to irreversible effects on aquatic ecosystems and their biodiversity. Lake Erie is one prominent example as this watershed has experienced multiple episodes of harmful algal blooms over the last decades. Annual P loads crucially depend on yearly weather variations, which can create the risk of years with high runoff and excessive nutrient loads. Here we apply stochastic modeling to derive sustainable management strategies that balance crop yield optimization with environmental protection, while accounting for weather variability as well as weather trends as a result of climate change. We demonstrate that ignoring annual weather variations results in mitigation efforts for environmental pollution that are largely insufficient. Accounting explicitly for future variations in precipitation allows us to control the risk of emissions exceeding the P target loads. When realistic risk targets are imposed, we find that a package of additional measures is required to avoid P over-enrichment in the Lake Erie watershed. This package consists of a substantial reduction of P inputs (approximately 30\% for different accepted risk levels), adoption of cover crops throughout the near- and mid-century, and cultivation of less nutrient-intensive crops (30\% more soy at the expense of corn). Although climate change reinforces these conclusions, we find that the accepted risk level of exceeding P target loads is the predominant factor in defining a sustainable nutrient management policy.},

	abstract = {Conservation agriculture (CA) is considered a sustainable practice with the potential to maintain or increase crop productivity and improve environmental quality and ecosystem services. It typically improves soil quality and water conservation; however, its effect on crop productivity is highly variable and dependent on local conditions/management. Crop residue retention plays a crucial role in CA and can help to improve overall soil health and ultimately crop productivity and sustainability. However, weed control, herbicide resistance, and weed shift under residue retained fields is a major challenge. Moreover, CA can increase water infiltration and reduce soil loss and runoff. This reduces the surface transport of nitrate and phosphorus from agricultural fields and the eutrophication of water bodies, although leaching of nitrate to groundwater can potentially increase. In addition, CA has been proposed as one of the components in climate-smart agriculture, owing to its reduced period to seed/plant next crop, reduced soil disturbance and low consumption of fossil fuels. Therefore, compared to the conventional intensive tillage, CA has a greater potential for soil C sequestration, favors higher soil biodiversity, lowers greenhouse gas emission, and can assist in mitigating climate change. However, not all experiments report a positive impact. The understanding and decoding the site-specific complexities of CA system is important and requires a multidisciplinary approach.},

	abstract = {As compost use in agriculture increases, there is an urgent need to evaluate the specific environmental benefits and impacts as compared with other types of fertilizers and soil amendments. While the environmental impacts associated with compost production have been successfully assessed in previous studies, the assessment of the benefits of compost on plant and soil has been only partially included in few published works. In the present study, we reviewed the recent progresses made in the quantification of the positive effects associated to biowaste compost use on land by using life cycle assessment (LCA). A total of nine environmental benefits were identified in an extensive literature review and quantitative figures for each benefit were drawn and classified into short-, mid-, and long-term. The major findings are the following: (1) for nutrient supply and carbon sequestration, the review showed that both quantification and impact assessment could be performed, meaning that these two benefits should be regularly included in LCA studies. (2) For pest and disease suppression, soil workability, biodiversity, crop nutritional quality, and crop yield, although the benefits were proved, quantitative figures could not be provided, either because of lack of data or because the benefits were highly variable and dependent on specific local conditions. (3) The benefits on soil erosion and soil moisture could be quantitatively addressed, but suitable impact assessment methodologies were not available. (4) Weed suppression was not proved. Different research efforts are required for a full assessment of the benefits, apart from nutrient supply and carbon sequestration; additional impact categories-dealing with phosphorus resources, biodiversity, soil losses, and water depletion-may be needed for a comprehensive assessment of compost application. Several of the natural mechanisms identified and the LCA procedures discussed in the paper could be extensible to other organic fertilizers and compost from other feedstocks.},

	abstract = {Poultry manure (PM) has become a serious environmental problem due to large scale of industrial production and unsustainable management, causing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), odors, leakage of nutrients as well as inorganic, organic and biological pollutants. The main goal of this review was to get a better understanding of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous cycles in processing of poultry manure with the most common technologies such as composting, anaerobic digestion, or thermal processes, e.g. pyrolysis. The carbon contained in organic matter (ca. 31\%) is mineralized and humified under aerobic conditions (matter recovery) and/or converted into biogas under anaerobic conditions (energy recovery). PM as a feedstock for pyrolysis to obtain biochar may effectively store and prevent C, thus contributing to climate change abatement. During composting, nitrogen is reduced from the compost mixture by leachates in the form of NH4+, NO3- or gaseous emissions of NH3, N2O, N-2. The C/N ratio is also decisive parameter. Most environmental threats of unmanaged PM result from ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions, being higher for PM compared to cattle and cow manure independently of technological processes. The phosphorous in PM is mainly inorganic (32-84\%). Using untreated manure as a fertilizer does not allow taking up high doses of phosphorus contained in poultry manure, so the excess accumulates in the soil and then leaches into groundwater. Biochar and struvite are an alternative to storage and source of high concentrations of phosphorous. Cycles of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus are an integral effect of technologies used for PM management.},

It also assesses the applicability of NT compared to conventional tillage (CT) systems with reference to a number of soil physical characteristics and processes known to have an important influence on water purification and retention functions. The literature search was carried out by a systematic approach where NT practices were assessed against soil structure, erosion, nutrient leaching/loss, water retention, infiltration and hydraulic conductivity (combinations of criteria = 40). Articles were selected based on their relevance in relation to the topic and location within NW Europe (n = 174). Results show that NT has large potential as an erosion mitigation measure in NW Europe with significant reductions of soil losses from agricultural fields, providing potential beneficial effects regarding inputs of sediment and particulate phosphorous (P) to water bodies. However, NT increased losses of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and had little effect on nitrogen (N) leaching, limiting the overall positive effects on water purification. Soil structural properties were often found to be poorer under NT than CT soils, resulting in decreased water infiltration rates and lower hydraulic conductivity. This was an effect of increased topsoil compaction, reduced porosity and high bulk density under NT, caused by the absence of topsoil inversion that breaks up compacted topsoil pans and enhances porosity under CT. However, several studies showed that soil structure under NT could be improved considerably by introducing cover crops, but root and canopy characteristics of the cover crop are crucial to the achieve the desired effect (e.g. thick rooted cover crops beneficial to soil structural remediation can cause negative effects in soils sensitive to erosion) and should be considered carefully before implementation. The contribution of NT practices to achieve Water Framework Directive (WFD) objectives in NW Europe is still uncertain, in particular in regards to water retention and flood mitigation, and more research is required on the total upscaled effects of NT practices on catchment or farm scale.},

Here, we configured five separate SWAT (US Department of Agriculture's Soil and Water Assessment Tool) models to assess load reduction strategies for the agriculturally dominated Maumee River watershed, the largest P source contributing to toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie. Although several potential pathways may achieve the target loads, our results show that any successful pathway will require large-scale implementation of multiple practices. For example, one successful pathway involved targeting 50\% of row cropland that has the highest P loss in the watershed with a combination of three practices: subsurface application of P fertilizers, planting cereal rye as a winter cover crop, and installing buffer strips. Achieving these levels of implementation will require local, state/provincial, and federal agencies to collaborate with the private sector to set shared implementation goals and to demand innovation and honest assessments of water quality-related programs, policies, and partnerships.},

We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular two-way fixed-effect specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation strategies that do not suffer from these drawbacks. Our results also cover cases where (i) there is no available untreated comparison group and (ii) there are multiple periods and variation in treatment timing, which are both common in empirical work.},

We show why these interaction term coefficients cannot be interpreted as a DIS or semielasticity in the same manner as continuous coefficients, which has been overlooked by some empirical researchers. Then we show how interaction terms can be easily transformed into a DIS and derive the asymptotic distribution of this estimator. We illustrate the discrepancy between the interaction term coefficient and the DIS using an empirical example evaluating the relationship between employment, private health insurance and physician office visits. Our results can be applied in treatment effect models when the outcome variable is logged and the dichotomous variables indicating treatment participation and the post-treatment time period.},

We propose a model that allows the control and treatment groups to have different average benefits from the treatment. The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean–variance trade-off. We also propose methods for inference, showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider extensions to allow for covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time periods.},

The standard practice is to take its logarithm and then interpret the results as an approximation of the multiplicative treatment effect on the original outcome. We argue that a researcher should rather focus on the non-transformed outcome when discussing causal inference. The first step should be to decide whether the time trend is more likely to hold in multiplicative or level form. If the former, it is preferable to estimate an exponential model by Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood, which does not require statistical independence of the error term. Running OLS on the log-linearised model might instead lead to confounding distributional and mean changes. We illustrate the argument with a simulation exercise.},

Drawing upon knowledge from a broad range of environmental variables that influence blue carbon sequestration, including warming, carbon dioxide levels, water depth, nutrients, runoff, bioturbation, physical disturbances, and tidal exchange, we discuss three potential management strategies that hold promise for optimizing coastal blue carbon sequestration: (1) reducing anthropogenic nutrient inputs, (2) reinstating top-down control of bioturbator populations, and (3) restoring hydrology. By means of case studies, we explore how these three strategies can minimize blue carbon losses and maximize gains. A key research priority is to more accurately quantify the impacts of these strategies on atmospheric greenhouse-gas emissions in different settings at landscape scales.},

	abstract = {As the climate change impacts are expected to become increasingly disruptive, affecting water security, environmental health and ecosystem, constructed wetlands receive attention for their functions in delivering various life-sustaining services to human and environmental systems. In this article, a systematic review was conducted through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses standard to identify the current research on constructed wetlands' nature values and services from 2011 to 2020 of two databases, namely Scopus and Web of Science. The criteria of assessment focus on holistic deliberation of subject matters, namely carbon sequestration and water security as regulating and provisioning services, as well as nature values of constructed wetlands, namely instrumental and intrinsic values. As a result, 38 articles were selected and comprehensively examined. As the lack of an interdisciplinary approach makes data and information integration difficult, this study derived an integrated classification of constructed wetlands' services and mapped with its nature values, guided by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment framework. Besides, mechanisms and factors affecting carbon sequestration and water security were also discussed. The carbon-water nexus was then conceptualised as interlinkages between engineered and natural physicochemical processes at the interface between carbon and water cycles. To fill the gaps, based on the carbon-water nexus concept, a new framework was synthesised at the end of the deliberation for constructed wetlands in regulating local climate through carbon sequestration and ensuring water security through water treatment and purification as well as influencing socio-cultural values, which needs an integrated approach that is the novelty of this work. The framework integrates the dichotomy of the instrumental-intrinsic nature values of constructed wetlands to evaluate the importance and benefit of the carbon-water nexus. The framework that reveals the vitality of nature values provided by constructed wetlands can help improve the decision-making to prioritise ecosystem services and conservation efforts, particularly in the sustainable management of constructed wetlands.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) budgets for large watersheds are often used to predict trends in riverine P export. To test such predictions, we calculated annual P budgets for 1975–1995 for soils of the Maumee and Sandusky watersheds of northwestern Ohio and compared them with riverine P export from these watersheds. Phosphorus inputs to the soils include fertilizers, manure, rainfall, and sludge while outputs include crop removal and nonpoint-source export via rivers. Annual P inputs decreased due to reductions in fertilizer and manure inputs. Annual outputs increased due to increasing crop yields. Net P accumulation decreased from peak values of 13.4 and 9.5 kg P ha−1 yr−1 to 3.7 and 2.6 kg P ha−1 yr−1 for the Maumee and Sandusky watersheds, respectively. Thus, P budget analysis suggests that riverine P export should have increased throughout the study period, with smaller increases during more recent years. However, detailed water quality studies show that riverine export of total phosphorus (TP) has decreased by 25 to 40\% and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) by 60 to 89\%, both due primarily to decreases from nonpoint sources. We suggest that these decreases are associated with farmers' adoption of practices that minimize transport of recently applied P fertilizer and of sediments via surface runoff, coupled with changes in winter weather conditions. In comparison with most Midwestern watersheds, rivers draining these watersheds have high unit area yields of TP, low unit area yields of SRP, and high ratios of nonpoint source– to point source–derived P.},

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) risk indices are commonly used in the USA to estimate the field-scale risk of agricultural P runoff. Because the Ohio P Risk Index is increasingly being used to judge farmer performance, it is important to evaluate weighting/scoring of all P Index parameters to ensure Ohio farmers are credited for practices that reduce P runoff risk and not unduly penalized for things not demonstrably related to runoff risk. A sensitivity analysis provides information as to how sensitive the P Index score is to changes in inputs. The objectives were to determine 1) which inputs are most highly associated with P Index scores and 2) the relative impact of each input variable on resultant P Index scores. The current approach uses simulations across 6134 Ohio point locations and five crop management scenarios (CMSs), representing increasing soil disturbance. The CMSs range from all no-till, which is being promoted in Ohio, rotational tillage, which is a common practice in Ohio to full tillage to represent an extreme practice. Results showed that P Index scores were best explained by soil test P (31.9\%) followed by connectivity to water (29.7\%), soil erosion (13.4\%), fertilizer application amount (11.3\%), runoff class (9.5\%), fertilizer application method (2.2\%), and finally filter strip (2.0\%). Ohio P Index simulations across CMSs one through five showed that {\textgreater}40\% scored {\textless}15 points (low) while {\textless}1.5\% scored {\textgreater}45 points (very high). Given Ohio water quality problems, the Ohio P Index needs to be stricter. The current approach is useful for Ohio P Index evaluations and revision decisions by spatially illustrating the impact of potential changes regionally and state-wide.},

	abstract = {The Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) was inundated with precipitation during June and July 2015 (two to three times greater than historical averages), which led to significant nutrient loading and the largest in-lake algal bloom on record. Using discharge and concentration data from three spatial scales (0.18–16,000 km2), we contrast the patterns in nitrate (NO3–N) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentration dynamics and discuss potential management implications. Across all scales, NO3–N concentration steadily declined with each subsequent rainfall event as it was flushed from the system. In contrast, DRP concentration persisted, even on soils at or below agronomic P levels, suggesting that legacy P significantly contributes to nutrient loads in the WLEB. These findings highlight the need to revisit current P fertility recommendations and soil testing procedures to increase P fertilizer use efficiency and to more holistically account for legacy P. Core Ideas Persistent P concentrations were measured from edge-of-field to basin scale. Persistent P concentrations after successive rainfall events are indicative of legacy P. Evidence of legacy P beckons for more comprehensive soil test metrics.},

	abstract = {Both abiotic and biotic explanations have been proposed to explain recent recurrent nuisance/harmful algal blooms in the western basin and central basin of Lake Erie. We used two long-term ({\textgreater}10years) datasets to test (1) whether Lake Erie total phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacterial biomass changed over time and (2) whether phytoplankton abundance was influenced by soluble reactive phosphorus or nitrate loading from agriculturally-dominated tributaries (Maumee and Sandusky rivers). We found that whereas total phytoplankton biomass decreased in Lake Erie's western basin from 1970 to 1987, it increased starting in the mid-1990s. Total phytoplankton and cyanobacterial seasonal (May–October) arithmetic mean wet-weight biomasses each significantly increased with increased water-year total soluble reactive phosphorus load from the Maumee River and the sum of soluble reactive phosphorus load from the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, but not for the Sandusky River alone during 1996–2006. During this same time period, neither total phytoplankton nor cyanobacterial biomass was correlated with nitrate load. Consequently, recently increased tributary soluble reactive phosphorus loads from the Maumee River likely contributed greatly to increased western basin and (central basin) cyanobacterial biomass and more frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms. Managers thus must incorporate the form of and source location from which nutrients are delivered to lakes into their management plans, rather than solely considering total (both in terms of form and amount) nutrient load to the whole lake. Further, future studies need to address the relative contributions of not only external loads, but also sources of internal loading.},

	abstract = {Nutrient enrichment of water bodies is one of the greatest stressors facing aquatic ecosystems worldwide. It is a problem faced in the Baltic Sea in Europe and the Laurentian Great Lakes in North America. Whilst progress was made in the Great Lakes during the 1990s to restore resiliency to the ecosystem, it is still a challenge in both basins today. This problem has been traced to a failure of governance, where traditional forms of government and legal steering have been unable to reduce nutrient inputs to the most polluted areas of the North American Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea. As such, governance innovations are needed to reduce nutrient inputs from agriculture and wastewater treatment plants, two of the biggest sources of land-based nutrients into these water bodies. Whilst a lot of the literature has focused on documenting the problems, there has been little attention on documenting novel governance innovations that have been working across scales to build adaptive capacity to nutrient abatement. This article fills this gap in the literature by looking at novel governance innovations across scales in the multi-level governance framework setting of the North American Great Lakes and the Baltic Sea steering mechanisms. It asks the question of what are the roles of actors other than the government in nutrient abatement. It examines innovations in governance by highlighting the role of new actors in building adaptive capacity through a focus on these determinants: public participation, science, networks, leadership, flexibility and resources.},

In particular, lack of understanding of the effects of weather in addition to how sampling effort determines calculated HOD rates complicates ecological understanding and environmental management of lake ecosystems. To better determine the roles of weather and sampling effort, we combined (1) weekly measurements of temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations from seven stations in the Sandusky subbasin of Lake Erie’s central basin during 2005, (2) contemporaneous measures of storm activity and tributary discharge, and (3) a two-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic, chemical, and biological model of Lake Erie to investigate (1) how increased storm activity and tributary discharge affected short- (daily) and long-term (seasonal) dynamics of hypolimnetic hypoxia, and (2) how spatial (number of sites sampled) and temporal (sampling frequency) sampling effort affected calculated HOD rates. Our model closely replicated field-observed DO dynamics. When comparing baseline modeled dynamics to those in a second simulation with twice the number of days with high winds, however, we found that with more storm activity (1) periods of entrainment became more frequent, (2) the hypolimnion was warmer, (3) thermal stratification occurred 1 month later, whereas autumnal turnover occurred at least 1 week earlier shortening the duration of stratification by 1–2 months, and (4) HOD rates increased 12\%. Further, spatial and temporal sampling intensity also affected calculated HOD rates. Consequently, adequately quantifying actual HOD rates requires sufficient sampling effort and the particular role of weather should be assessed with rigorous field and simulation studies, especially if HOD rates are used to indicate management success.},

Environmental managers have called for major reductions in sediment and phosphorus loadings from Lake Erie tributaries. In this study, thirty-year datasets (Water Years 1975-2004) with daily resolution are analyzed to identify and interpret trends in suspended sediment and particulate phosphorus concentrations and loads in two major US tributaries to Lake Erie. The Maumee and Sandusky Rivers in agricultural northwest Ohio show continual decreases in concentrations and loads throughout this period. The greatest decreases are observed in summer and fall and under low flow conditions, whereas the smallest decreases are observed in the spring and under high flow conditions. Analysis of concentration-flow relationships indicates that these changes are not due to weather but reflect the successful use of agricultural practices to reduce erosion and prevent sediment loss. Opportunities for further reductions in suspended sediment and particulate phosphorus loads and concentrations lie in better management of sediment losses during winter and spring.},

	abstract = {Including cover crops within agricultural rotations may increase soil organic carbon (SOC). However, contradictory findings generated by on-site experiments make it necessary to perform a comprehensive assessment of interactions between cover crops, environmental and management factors, and changes in SOC. In this study, we collected data from studies that compared agricultural production with and without cover crops, and then analyzed those data using meta-analysis and regression. Our results showed that including cover crops into rotations significantly increased SOC, with an overall mean change of 15.5\% (95\% confidence interval of 13.8\%-17.3\%). Whereas medium-textured soils had highest SOC stocks (overall means of 39 Mg ha(-1) with and 37 Mg ha(-1) without cover crops), fine-textured soils showed the greatest increase in SOC after the inclusion of cover crops (mean change of 39.5\%). Coarse-textured (11.4\%) and medium-textured soils (10.3\%) had comparatively smaller changes in SOC, while soils in temperate climates had greater changes (18.7\%) than those in tropical climates (7.2\%). Cover crop mixtures resulted in greater increases in SOC compared to mono-species cover crops, and using legumes caused greater SOC increases than grass species. Cover crop biomass positively affected SOC changes while carbon:nitrogen ratio of cover crop biomass was negatively correlated with SOC changes. Cover cropping was associated with significant SOC increases in shallow soils ({\textless}= 30 cm), but not in subsurface soils ({\textgreater}30 cm). The regression analysis revealed that SOC changes from cover cropping correlated with improvements in soil quality, specifically decreased runoff and erosion and increased mineralizable carbon, mineralizable nitrogen, and soil nitrogen. Soil carbon change was also affected by annual temperature, number of years after start of cover crop usage, latitude, and initial SOC concentrations. Finally, the mean rate of carbon sequestration from cover cropping across all studies was 0.56 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) . If 15\% of current global cropland were to adopt cover crops, this value would translate to 0.16 +/- 0.06 Pg of carbon sequestered per year, which is similar to 1-2\% of current fossil fuels emissions. Altogether, these results indicated that the inclusion of cover crops into agricultural rotations can enhance soil carbon concentrations, improve many soil quality parameters, and serve as a potential sink for atmosphere CO2.},

	abstract = {Increasing the quantity and quality of plant biomass production in space and time can improve the capacity of agroecosystems to capture and store atmospheric carbon (C) in the soil. Cover cropping is a key practice to increase system net primary productivity (NPP) and increase the quantity of high-quality plant residues available for integration into soil organic matter (SOM). Cover crop management and local environmental conditions, however, influence the magnitude of soil C stock change. Here, we used a comprehensive meta-analysis approach to quantify the effect of cover crops on soil C stocks from the 0-30 cm soil depth in temperate climates and to identify key management and ecological factors that impact variation in this response. A total of 40 publications with 181 observations were included in the meta-analysis representing six countries across three different continents. Overall, cover crops had a strong positive effect on soil C stocks (P {\textless} 0.0001) leading to a 12\% increase, averaging 1.11 Mg C/ha more soil C relative to a no cover crop control. The strongest predictors of SOC response to cover cropping were planting and termination date (i.e., growing window), annual cover crop biomass production, and soil clay content. Cover crops planted as continuous cover or autumn planted and terminated led to 20-30\% greater total soil C stocks relative to other cover crop growing windows. Likewise, high annual cover crop biomass production ({\textgreater}7 Mg center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) resulted in 30\% higher total soil C stocks than lower levels of biomass production. Managing for greater NPP by improving synchronization in cover crop growing windows and climate will enhance the capacity of this practice to drawdown carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere across agroecosystems. The integration of growing window (potentially as a proxy for biomass growth), climate, and soil factors in decision-support tools are relevant for improving the quantification of soil C stock change under cover crops, particularly with the expansion of terrestrial soil C markets.},

	abstract = {Meta-analysis is often used to compare how soil health differs between organic and conventional farming systems. However, the burgeoning primary literature on organic farming now allows direct evaluation of the best management practices (BMPs) within organic farming systems on soil health improvements. Therefore, the main objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of BMPs, such as organic amendments, conservation tillage, and cover cropping, on soil health within organic farming systems. We focused on two principal soil health metrics: soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) concentrations. On average, adoption of BMPs increased depth-weighted SOC and MBC concentrations by 18 and 30 \%, respectively, relative to organically-managed control groups. Among BMPs, organic amendments and conservation tillage practices showed net positive effect on soil health with 24 and 14 \% increase in depth-weighted SOC concentrations, respectively. Although cover cropping did not have an overall influence on SOC concentrations, we found a temporal trend such that cover cropping significantly increased SOC concentrations after 5 years of its adoption. This indicates that the soil health benefits from BMPs accrue over time and highlights the need of long-term adoptability of BMPs to achieve agricultural sustainability. Future primary articles that focus on under researched cropping practices in organic systems (e.g., crop rotation length and diversity, biochar addition) and the additive effects of multiple BMPs on soil health, will add to the synthesizable evidence base. Therefore, this meta-analysis confirms the soil health benefits of adopting BMPs within organic farming systems, identifies critical knowledge gaps, and provides directions for future organic farming research.},

However, current measurements regarding the influences of CSA management practices on SOC sequestration diverge widely, making it difficult to derive conclusions about individual and combined CSA management effects and bringing large uncertainties in quantifying the potential of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate change. We conducted a meta-analysis of 3,049 paired measurements from 417 peer-reviewed articles to examine the effects of three common CSA management practices on SOC sequestration as well as the environmental controlling factors. We found that, on average, biochar applications represented the most effective approach for increasing SOC content (39\%), followed by cover crops (6\%) and conservation tillage (5\%). Further analysis suggested that the effects of CSA management practices were more pronounced in areas with relatively warmer climates or lower nitrogen fertilizer inputs. Our meta-analysis demonstrated that, through adopting CSA practices, cropland could be an improved carbon sink. We also highlight the importance of considering local environmental factors (e.g., climate and soil conditions and their combination with other management practices) in identifying appropriate CSA practices for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring crop productivity.},

However, little is known regarding the effect of cover crop species, biomass quality and quantity, and method of residue placement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using meta-analysis, this study examined the effect of cover crop species, quality and quantity of biomass, and residue management on response ratios (RRs) of cover crops to no cover crop on CO2 and N2O emissions following cash crops. All cover crop species increased CO2 emissions, but reduced N2O emissions compared with no cover crop, except legumes which increased N2O emissions. Cover crop biomass explained 63\% of variability in increased CO2 emissions and 55\% of variability in decreased N2O emissions. Both CO2 and N2O emissions decreased polynomially with increased cover crop biomass C/N ratio, with greater rate of decline for legumes than nonlegumes. Cover crop residue incorporated into the soil increased CO2 and N2O emissions compared with the residue placed at surface or removed from the soil. Cover crops emitted lower CO2 and N2O emissions than no cover crops in silty loam and sandy clay loam soils, respectively, compared to clay loam and silty clay loam soils. Both soil organic carbon and total nitrogen increased with cover crop compared to no cover crop. Although CO2 and N2O emissions varied with cover crop species, using legume and nonlegume cover crop mixture to enhance residue C/N ratio compared to legumes and placing the residue at the surface instead of incorporating into the soil can reduce GHG emissions. Because of enhanced soil C and N storage and other known benefits, improvement in soil health and environmental quality due to cover crop may outweigh CO2 emissions compared to no cover crop.},

	abstract = {Regenerative Agriculture (RA) claims to build soil organic carbon (SOC) and increase crop yields through simultaneous adoption of a suite of management practices which restore soil health. However, this claim is largely unevidenced as few studies of fully integrated regenerative systems are currently available. As a first step to addressing this knowledge gap, we here examine three practices now being promoted as part of RA: reducing tillage intensity, cover cropping and including a grass-based phase in arable rotations (ley-arable rotations). Our Bayesian meta-analysis of 195 paired SOC and crop yield observations from a systematic review of published studies finds statistically significant increases in SOC concentration for reduced tillage intensity (0.06 g C center dot 100 g(-1)) and ley-arable rotations (0.05 g C center dot 100(-1) g yr(-1) of ley) compared to conventional practice over an average study duration of 15 years, but no effect of cover crops. None of these practices reduce yield during cropping years, although we find no evidence of a win-win between increasing SOC and enhanced agricultural productivity following adoption. Future work should also evaluate the net greenhouse gas emission implications of each practice and potential for synergistic effects if RA practices are adopted in combination. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the RA practices investigated here can be promoted by land managers and policy makers without crop yield losses.},

	abstract = {Widespread adoption of improved cropland management measures is advocated to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) levels, thereby improving soil fertility and mitigating climate change. However, spatially explicit insight on management impacts is limited, which is crucial for region-specific and climate-smart practices. To overcome these limitations, we combined global meta-analytical results on improved management practices on SOC sequestration with spatially explicit data on current management practices and potential areas for the adoption of these measures. We included (a) fertilization practices, i.e., use of organic fertilizer compared to inorganic fertilizer or no fertilizer, (b) soil tillage practices, i.e., no-tillage relative to high or intermediate intensity tillage, and (c) crop management practices, i.e., use of cover crops and enhanced crop residue incorporation. We show that the estimated global C sequestration potential varies between 0.44 and 0.68 Gt C yr(-1), assuming maximum complementarity among all measures taken. A more realistic estimate, not assuming maximum complementarity, is from 0.28 to 0.43 Gt C yr(-1), being on the lower end of the current range of 0.1-2 Gt C yr(-1) found in the literature. One reason for the lower estimate is the limited availability of manure that has not yet been recycled. Another reason is the limited area for the adoption of improved measures, considering their current application and application limitations. We found large regional differences in carbon sequestration potential due to differences in yield gaps, SOC levels, and current practices applied. The highest potential is found in regions with low crop production, low initial SOC levels, and in regions where livestock manure and crop residues are only partially recycled. Supporting previous findings, we highlight that to encourage both soil fertility and SOC sequestration, it is best to focus on agricultural soils with large yield gaps and/or where SOC values are below levels that may limit crop production.},

However, the effects of these practices differ due to diverse climatic scenario, soil characteristics and management system. To identify the suitable practices that can be effective under tropical and subtropical conditions, a systematic evaluation in the form of a meta-analysis of these practices and their outcomes was performed over those regions. In this work we have included 516 observations from 84 articles published from 2000 to 2021 to analyse the influence of three CSA practices (conservation tillage, cover crop and biochar application) on the SOC (soil organic carbon) stocks over varying periods of experimentation. In addition to this, the combined effect of CSA and other conservation agronomic practices such as agroforestry has also been considered in the analysis. The results showed that biochar application had the most influence upon SOC stocks in the agricultural lands (25.38\%) followed by conservation tillage (18.81\%) and cover crop (15.8\%). Medium term experiments (6–20 years) of these conservation practices showed about 31.00–96.15\%improvement in SOC while the effects gradually diminished in long term experiments ({\textgreater}20 years). The combinations of these practices have been observed to have an evidently positive impact upon the SOC stocks in general. This work provides a systematic evaluation of all the widely performed CSA and other conservation practices and their effects on SOC dynamics under differing management settings.},

The C sequestration potential of the world's cropland soil is 0.4-0.8 Pg soil C year(-1), which may be achieved through the adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs), including fertilizer management. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the influence of long-term application of different fertilizers and straw retention on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, to compare the calculated response ratios with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-recommended default relative stock change factors, and to propose recommendations for enhancing SOC sequestration. The meta-analysis indicated that the long-term application of chemical fertilizers (CF), organic fertilizers (OF), combined chemical and organic fertilizers (CFOF), and straw return (SR) significantly enhanced the SOC storage. Response ratios varied significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) across different fertilization measures and climatic zones, and was sensitive to the initial SOC content. The mean response ratio was 0.94 for no fertilizer (NF), 1.08 for CF, 1.48 for OF, 1.38 for CFOF, and 1.28 for SR. When IPCC default values for response ratios were applied, SOC storage with OF and CFOF treatments in warm temperate regions with a dry climate was underestimated by 26\%, and in the cool temperate region with a moist climate was overestimated by 25\% (p {\textless} 0.05). Analysis showed that sustained application of organic fertilizers and straw return could be a beneficial measures to mitigate climate change and ensure food security in China. Our findings highlight the importance of deriving SOC stock change factors for a detailed classification of cropland by fertilizer management, climate, and soil types in order to more accurately reflect the effects of policy measures.},

However, the overall trend and magnitude of changes in soil C in response to straw return remain uncertain. In this meta-analysis, we calculated the response ratios of soil organic C (SOC) concentrations, greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission, nutrient contents and other important soil properties to straw addition in 176 published field studies. Our results indicated that straw return significantly increased SOC concentration by 12.8 +/- 0.4\% on average, with a 27.4 +/- 1.4\% to 56.6 +/- 1.8\% increase in soil active C fraction. CO2 emission increased in both upland (27.8 +/- 2.0\%) and paddy systems (51.0 +/- 2.0\%), while CH4 emission increased by 110.7 +/- 1.2\% only in rice paddies. N2O emission has declined by 15.2 +/- 1.1\% in paddy soils but increased by 8.3 +/- 2.5\% in upland soils. Responses of macro-aggregates and crop yield to straw return showed positively linear with increasing SOC concentration. Straw-C input rate and clay content significantly affected the response of SOC. A significant positive relationship was found between annual SOC sequestered and duration, suggesting that soil C saturation would occur after 12years under straw return. Overall, straw return was an effective means to improve SOC accumulation, soil quality, and crop yield. Straw return-induced improvement of soil nutrient availability may favor crop growth, which can in turn increase ecosystem C input. Meanwhile, the analysis on net global warming potential (GWP) balance suggested that straw return increased C sink in upland soils but increased C source in paddy soils due to enhanced CH4 emission. Our meta-analysis suggested that future agro-ecosystem models and cropland management should differentiate the effects of straw return on ecosystem C budget in upland and paddy soils.},

These blooms pose potential health risks for recreation, and impact the treatment of drinking water. Understanding the timing and distribution of the blooms may aid in planning by local communities and resources managers. Satellite data provides a means of examining spatial patterns of the blooms. Data sets from MERIS (2002–2012) and MODIS (2012–2014) were analyzed to evaluate bloom patterns and frequencies. The blooms were identified using previously published algorithms to detect cyanobacteria ({\textasciitilde}25,000 cells mL−1), as well as a variation of these algorithms to account for the saturation of the MODIS ocean color bands. Images were binned into 10-day composites to reduce cloud and mixing artifacts. The 13 years of composites were used to determine frequency of presence of both detectable cyanobacteria and high risk  ({\textgreater}100,000 cells mL−1) blooms. The bloom season according to the satellite observations falls within June 1 and October 31. Maps show the pattern of development and areas most commonly impacted during all years (with minor and severe blooms). Frequencies during years with just severe blooms (minor bloom years were not included in the analysis) were examined in the same fashion. With the annual forecasts of bloom severity, these frequency maps can provide public water suppliers and health departments with guidance on the timing of potential risk.},

	abstract = {Previous studies indicate that cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (cyanoHAB) frequency, extent, and magnitude have increased globally over the past few decades. However, little quantitative capability is available to assess these metrics of cyanoHABs across broad geographic scales and at regular intervals. Here, the spatial extent was quantified from a cyanobacteria algorithm applied to two European Space Agency satellite platforms—the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard Envisat and the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-3. CyanoHAB spatial extent was defined for each geographic area as the percentage of valid satellite pixels that exhibited cyanobacteria above the detection limit of the satellite sensor. This study quantified cyanoHAB spatial extent for over 2,000 large lakes and reservoirs across the contiguous United States (CONUS) during two time periods: 2008–2011 via MERIS and 2017–2020 via OLCI when cloud-, ice-, and snow-free imagery was available. Approximately 56\% of resolvable lakes were glaciated, 13\% were headwater, isolated, or terminal lakes, and the rest were primarily drainage lakes. Results were summarized at national-, regional-, state-, and lake-scales, where regions were defined as nine climate regions which represent climatically consistent states. As measured by satellite, changes in national cyanoHAB extent did have a strong increase of 6.9\% from 2017 to 2020 ({\textbar}Kendall’s tau (τ){\textbar} = 0.56; gamma (γ) = 2.87 years), but had negligible change ({\textbar}τ{\textbar} = 0.03) from 2008 to 2011. Two of the nine regions had moderate (0.3 ≤ {\textbar}τ{\textbar} {\textless} 0.5) increases in spatial extent from 2017 to 2020, and eight of nine regions had negligible ({\textbar}τ{\textbar} {\textless} 0.2) change from 2008 to 2011. Twelve states had a strong or moderate increase from 2017 to 2020 ({\textbar}τ{\textbar} ≥ 0.3), while only one state had a moderate increase and two states had a moderate decrease from 2008 to 2011. A decrease, or no change, in cyanoHAB spatial extent did not indicate a lack of issues related to cyanoHABs. Sensitivity results of randomly omitted daily CONUS scenes confirm that even with reduced data availability during a short four-year temporal assessment, the direction and strength of the changes in spatial extent remained consistent. We present the first set of national maps of lake cyanoHAB spatial extent across CONUS and demonstrate an approach for quantifying past and future changes at multiple spatial scales. Results presented here provide water quality managers information regarding current cyanoHAB spatial extent and quantify rates of change.},

However, in situ sampling of cyanobacteria in inland lakes is limited both spatially and temporally. Satellite data has proven to be an effective tool to monitor cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes across the United States. This study uses data from the European Space Agency Envisat MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument to provide a national overview of the percentage of lakes experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom on a weekly basis for 2008–2011, 2017, and 2018. A total of 2321 lakes across the contiguous United States were included in the analysis. We examined four different thresholds to define when a waterbody is classified as experiencing a bloom. Across these four thresholds, we explored variability in bloom percentage with changes in seasonality and lake size. As a validation of algorithm performance, we analyzed the agreement between satellite observations and previously established ecological patterns, although data availability in the wintertime limited these comparisons on a year-round basis. Changes in cyanobacterial bloom percentage at the national scale followed the well-known temporal pattern of freshwater blooms. The percentage of lakes experiencing a bloom increased throughout the year, reached a maximum in fall, and decreased through the winter. Wintertime data, particularly in northern regions, were consistently limited due to snow and ice cover. With the exception of the Southeast and South, regional patterns mimicked patterns found at the national scale. The Southeast and South exhibited an unexpected pattern as cyanobacterial bloom percentage reached a maximum in the winter rather than the summer. Lake Jesup in Florida was used as a case study to validate this observed pattern against field observations of chlorophyll a. Results from this research establish a baseline of annual occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes across the United States. In addition, methods presented in this study can be tailored to fit the specific requirements of an individual system or region.},

	abstract = {Soils are important global carbon pools that are under threat from intensive land use through a variety of agricultural practices. Sustainable management of agricultural soils may have the potential to mitigate climate change through increased carbon sequestration and increase their fertility. Among management practices to increase carbon sequestration, crop rotation designs have often been tested on yield effects in long-term agricultural experiments. However, in these studies, soil organic carbon (SOC) was monitored but not always the key objective. Thus, here we provide a method for a systematic review to test the effects of common crop rotations on SOC sequestration to provide evidence on the most sustainable management regimes that can promote SOC storage. This systematic review incorporates studies concerning selected crop rotations (rotations-vs-monocultures, legumes-vs-no legumes, and perennials-vs-annuals) collated in a recently completed systematic map on the effect of agricultural management on SOC, restricted to boreo-temperate systems (i.e., the warm temperate climate zone). Some 208 studies relevant for this systematic review were identified in the systematic map. An update of the original search (September 2013) will be undertaken to identify newly published academic and grey literature. Studies will be critically appraised for their internal and external validity, followed by full data extraction (meta-data describing study settings and quantitative study results). Where possible, studies will be included in meta-analyses examining the effects of the different rotational practices. Implications of the findings will be discussed in terms of policy, practice and research, and the nature of the evidence base.},

Research relating transport of each to the others through the constructed drainage network to receiving streams is sparse. The main objective of this work was to quantify and characterize concentrations and yields of inorganic and organic carbon (IC and OC) along with nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) using a four-year dataset that included discharge from two managed drainage districts in the Combelt state of Iowa. Our analysis shows loss of carbon through these constructed drainage networks averages 124 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) with more than 90\% of this total in carbonate form and only 7\% in organic forms, a small amount relative to soil organic stores. Transport of NO3-N can total as much as 97 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Although loads of IC, OC and NO3-N all vary similarly with discharge, NO3-N is especially transport-limited. Elevated OC concentrations in March are likely linked to recent manure application to soil surfaces, with concentrations returning to a consistent baseline thereafter. Concentrations of IC are lowest at high flows, indicating dilution by fresh water from recent hydrologic events into the drainage system which disproportionately mobilize NO3-N compared to IC. Although yields of IC and OC to the drainage system indicate tile drainage does not threaten to deplete soil organic matter stores, returning the system to a condition where carbon and nitrogen cycle together could improve stream water quality.},

	abstract = {One of the adverse effects of no-tillage is the accumulation of nutrients (in particular P and K) in the top soil layer. The subsurface application of mineral fertilizers at a depth of 10-30 cm can reduce this phenomenon and at the same time provide a relatively uniform access to soil nutrients for plant roots. Such a method of mineral fertilizer application can additionally decrease the environmental risk associated with water eutrophication because the water runoff from fields, where the soil P content is high, is reduced. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of the subsurface application of different rates of a compound mineral fertilizer on the content of some macronutrients, soil organic carbon content (SOC), and soil pH in a field after the harvest of soybean grown under reduced tillage conditions. The field experiment was conducted during the growing seasons of 2014/2015-2016/2017 in the village of Rogow, Zamosc County, Poland. It was set up as a split-plot design in four replicates. The first experimental factor included two methods of mineral fertilization application: fertilizer broadcast over the soil surface (S); fertilizer applied deep (subsurface placed) using a specially designed cultivator (Sub-S). The other factor was the rates of the mineral fertilizer (NPKS): 85 kg.ha(-1) (F85) and 170 kg.ha(-1) (F170). Over the successive years of the study, the SOC content was found to increase. However, neither the fertilization rate nor the method of fertilizer application caused any significant difference in organic carbon. Under subsurface fertilizer application conditions, a higher soil pH was found in treatment F85, however, when the fertilizer was surface-applied, the soil in treatment F170 had a higher pH value. During the three-year study period, the P and K content in the 0-30 cm soil layer was higher than in the 30-60 cm and 60-90 cm layers. In turn, the highest Mg content was determined in the 30-60 cm layer. In the case of both mineral fertilizer application methods, a higher P content was determined in the soil fertilized at a rate of 170 kg NPKS, compared with a rate of 85 kg.ha(-1). The surface application of the higher rate of mineral fertilization resulted in an increase in the soil K content. On the other hand, when the mineral fertilizer was subsurface-applied, a higher soil K was determined in the treatments with lower mineral fertilization.},

	abstract = {Agricultural phosphorus (P) loss has been linked to the eutrophication of surface water bodies throughout the world. As a result, minimizing offsite P transport has become a priority in many rural watersheds. In the US Midwest and other subsurface tile-drained regions, there is a critical need to identify nutrient management practices that decrease P loss in both surface and subsurface discharge. An edge-of-field (EOF) network monitoring 38 agricultural fields was established in northwest Ohio, United States, to quantify the impacts of prevailing and novel crop production and conservation management practices on surface and subsurface P concentrations and loads. In this study, we evaluate nutrient management practices across these fields with varying characteristics in order to identify a suite of management practices within the 4R nutrient management framework (right source, right rate, right time, and right place) that reduce agricultural P loss in artificially drained landscapes. EOF monitoring data indicate that applying organic fertilizers at P-based rates, soil testing and following recommended application rates, avoiding fertilizer application during wet periods of the year (e.g., winter and early spring) and prior to large precipitation events, and placing fertilizer below the surface are all practices that result in decreased P loss. Findings also highlight the importance of field hydrology on surface and subsurface P transport and suggest that water management practices may also be effective at decreasing P loss. While the effectiveness of the nutrient management practices evaluated in this study will likely vary across fields with different characteristics, implementation of these practices should be considered a directionally correct (i.e., will reduce nutrient loss) approach for addressing excess P loss from artificially drained landscapes.},

	abstract = {The Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) project was conducted by the US Department of Agriculture’s National Resources Conservation Service between 2010–2012 in order to provide contemporaneous measurements of soil organic carbon (SOC) across the US. Despite the broad extent of the RaCA data collection effort, direct observations of SOC are not available at the high spatial resolution needed for studying carbon storage in soil and its implications for important problems in climate science and agriculture. As a result, there is a need for predicting SOC at spatial locations not included as part of the RaCA project. In this paper, we compare spatial prediction of SOC using a subset of the RaCA data for a variety of statistical methods. We investigate the performance of methods with off-the-shelf software available (both stationary and nonstationary) as well as a novel nonstationary approach based on partitioning relevant spatially-varying covariate processes. Our new method addresses open questions regarding (1) how to partition the spatial domain for segmentation-based nonstationary methods, (2) incorporating partially observed covariates into a spatial model, and (3) accounting for uncertainty in the partitioning. In applying the various statistical methods we find that there are minimal differences in out-of-sample criteria for this particular data set, however, there are major differences in maps of uncertainty in SOC predictions. We argue that the spatially-varying measures of prediction uncertainty produced by our new approach are valuable to decision makers, as they can be used to better benchmark mechanistic models, identify target areas for soil restoration projects, and inform carbon sequestration projects.},

We compared local models with the global models and PLSR versus ANN. ANN models outperform PLSR in global models, but local models improve substantially in PLSR. Overall, local PLSR models developed from Horizon and Texture are most favorable Visible and near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VisNIR) has been used across a number of spatial scales to predict soil organic carbon (OC) content. The Rapid Carbon Assessment Project (RaCA) is a nationwide project that collected 144,000+ soil samples from across the conterminous United States for C stock mapping using VisNIR. The objective of this study was to calibrate and validate the VisNIR soil OC and total C (TC) models with ∼20,000 samples from RaCA. Models were developed with either partial least squares regression (PLSR) or the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Four auxiliary variables—RaCA Region, Land Use Land Cover, Master Horizon, and Textural Class—were tested to stratify the dataset and to develop local models. The results showed that OC and TC models calibrated with ANN (R2 {\textgreater} 0.94; RPD {\textgreater} 4.0) outperformed those of PLSR (R2 = 0.83; RPD = 2.4). For PLSR, local models developed with all four auxiliary variables exhibited improvement in prediction accuracy, and the improvement was only marginal for ANN models. Master Horizon and Textural Class appeared to be more effective in stratifying samples into homogeneous groups because they gave an overall lower root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for the validation samples. For the majority of the local Textural Class models, the RMSEP of OC prediction ranged from 0.5 to 1.5\%. To maximize the applicability of the RaCA spectral library on external soil samples, PLSR local models developed from Master Horizon or Textural Class appeared to be more favorable.},

	abstract = {The Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) project was undertaken by the Soil Science Division of the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) to capture baseline soil carbon stocks across the conterminous US (CONUS). A multi-level hierarchical design was used to ensure that samples were distributed across regions, soils and land use/land cover classes (LULC). Within those strata, sites were selected at random locations where five pedons were described and sampled at 0-5 cm and by genetic horizon from 5 to 100 cm. A total of 6,148 sites, 32,084 pedons and 144,833 samples were described. Bulk density was calculated for samples from the upper 50 cm and predicted for deeper samples using pedon and horizon information in a regression tree developed with random forests. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration was predicted for each sample using processed Visible-Near Infrared spectra and a random forest model. Pedon SOC stocks were calculated by fixed depth to 100 cm. Expected variance was introduced into the stock calculations using analytical and modeling prediction errors (e. g., SOC concentration and bulk density measurements) and the stratified sampling design was partitioned using a hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach. Pedons were averaged by site. The mean of all RaCA site SOC stocks to 100 cm was 321.1, with a median of 173.3 and range of 2 to over 5,000 Mg ha(-1). Geometric means of soil groups and LULC classes were used to extrapolate results to all assessed areas. Further work is needed to properly weight averages by areal extent and assess the cause of higher than expected site SOC stock values.},

	abstract = {Post agricultural grasslands are considered to accumulate soil organic carbon (SOC) after cultivation cessation. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the U.S. is a wide scale, covering approximately 8.9 Mha as of 2020, example of row-crop to grassland conversion. To date, SOC sequestration rates, and potential, in CRP has mostly been evaluated at local scales and focused on the surface 20–30 cm of the soil profile. Thus, we lack knowledge of C sequestration rates in CRP lands on a continental scale and of C dynamics in the subsurface soil after agricultural cessation. The Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) project is the most recent effort by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to systematically quantify C stock in the 0-100 cm soil profiles across the conterminous US. Here we analyze data from RaCA to evaluate the C stocks of the CRP on a continental scale of both surface and subsurface soil. We found there was no difference in SOC stock between croplands and CRP lands when comparing the 0-100 cm soil profiles, which indicates that the C sequestration in CRP lands is insignificant overall. We did find that SOC accumulated in the surface soil (0–5 cm) in CRP lands. However, theses C gains in surface (0–5 cm) soil were offset by the lower SOC stock in the subsurface (30–100 cm) of the CRP. We also found that the C: N ratio in the subsurface soil in CRP lands is lower than that of croplands, indicating a lack of labile organic matter inputs in the subsoil. Whether the lower SOC in the subsurface of CRP is caused by legacy effects or is a result of C losses needs to be verified by long-term repeated sampling in both surface and subsurface soil. This analysis highlights the importance of examining C dynamics in subsurface soil after agricultural cessation to accurately measure and improve C sequestration rates in CRP lands.},

	abstract = {Elevated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have resulted in growing societal interest in natural climate solutions that include enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC). This study evaluated SOC from three USDA soil databases for Maine, a state that is nearly 90\% forested. These databases were: (1) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), (2) NRCS Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO), and (3) Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA). We compared estimates of SOC density and concentration among databases and analyzed relationships between key soil properties and SOC densities and concentrations. Estimates of SOC density to a 20 cm depth which allows comparison among all three databases were 77 ± 1.2 Mg ha−1, 95 ± 0.3 Mg ha−1, and 39 ± 2.2 Mg ha−1 for SSURGO, RaCA, and FIA, respectively. Significant differences existed among databases in SOC density at shallow depth increments, and marked differences existed among databases in the soil depths measured. Analysis of the influence of soil texture and drainage class on SOC highlighted the importance of silt and clay in SOC retention. A hypothetical increase in forest and agricultural SOC was compared to reported Maine GHG emissions to illustrate potential policy implications in the use of soil databases. We conclude that all three databases are valuable but not interchangeable. The database should be carefully chosen to match the objectives of the user.},

	abstract = {Cropland carbon budget depicts the amount of carbon flowing in and out of agroecosystems and the changes in carbon stocks of soil and living biomass during the same period. Soil carbon credit is the additional change in soil carbon stock under certain farming practices compared with the business-as-usual practices. Accurately calculating cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit is critical to assessing climate change mitigation potential in agroecosystems. The calculation of cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit is sensitive to local soil and climatic conditions, especially initial soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, which is determined by both SOC concentration (SOC\%) and bulk density (Bulk\_Density). SOC stock data are either from soil sampling or gridded public survey data. In agroecosystem models, SOC stock data are a key model input for quantifying cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit. However, various types and degrees of uncertainties exist in SOC stock datasets, which propagate to the quantification of SOC stock change. In particular, a large discrepancy is found in two widely used SOC stock datasets — Rapid Carbon Assessment dataset (RaCA) and Gridded Soil Survey Geographic Database (gSSURGO) — in the U.S. Midwest, with a relative difference (quantified using Normalized Root Mean Square Error, NRMSE) of 48.0\% for 0–30 cm SOC stock between the two datasets. It remains largely unclear how uncertainty in SOC stocks affects the calculation of cropland carbon budget and soil carbon credit. To address this question, we used a well-validated process-based agroecosystem model, ecosys, to assess the impacts of SOC stock uncertainty on carbon budget and soil carbon credit calculation in the U.S. Midwestern corn-soybean rotation systems. Our results reveal the following findings: (1) A sizable discrepancy exists in simulated cropland carbon budget between using gSSURGO and using RaCA for their SOC\% and Bulk\_Density as model inputs, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of only 0.4 for simulated change of SOC stock (ΔSOC) using these two different soil datasets. (2) Simulated cropland carbon budget components were more sensitive to initial SOC\% than to Bulk\_Density. For example, the upper and lower quartiles of multi-year averaged ΔSOC were −29.8 and 4.8 gC/m2/year for the selected counties respectively, with an uncertainty of 13.7 and 0.7 gC/m2/year induced by uncertainties in initial SOC\% and Bulk\_Density, respectively. (3) Both simulated ΔSOC and its uncertainty were negatively correlated with initial SOC\%, whereas ΔSOC was negatively correlated with air temperature, and ΔSOC uncertainty was positively correlated with air temperature. (4) The uncertainty of calculated soil carbon credits was much smaller compared with the uncertainty of calculated absolute carbon budgets assuming the same SOC stock uncertainty level in the inputs. Specifically, in our assessment comparing planting cover crops vs no cover crop, the uncertainty of calculated soil carbon credits induced by initial SOC\% uncertainty was less than 4\% (relative to the quantified value of the soil carbon credits) for 90\% of the cases. Our analysis highlights that high accuracy measurement of SOC\% as inputs is needed for the calculation of cropland carbon budgets; however, soil carbon credit quantification is much less sensitive to the initial SOC\% inputs, and the current publicly available soil datasets (e.g., gSSURGO) are largely suitable for the calculation of soil carbon credits.},

	abstract = {Land management and land cover change exert a strong influence on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. As scientific, political, and business communities increase their awareness of the essential roles SOC plays in climate regulation and ecosystem functions, efforts to quantify the impacts of land use and management on SOC have increased rapidly. Existing methods of estimating SOC stocks from widely available data do not account for land cover, and are therefore of limited usefulness in understanding the impacts of past and future land use change. This project explores a method of linking land cover to SOC using data from public datasets and the scientific literature, to provide an SOC Inventory for Massachusetts, and compares the results to those derived from a common baseline approach. Our method derives average land cover SOC values by combining data from the USDA-NRCS Rapid Carbon Assessment and the National Cooperative Soil Characterization Database with values from a meta-analysis of scientific literature. These are applied to the total area of the 20 most abundant land cover classes of Massachusetts. We compare this land cover-based approach with a baseline using SOC values found in the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), applied to each soil map unit found within Massachusetts. Our approach produced an estimated stock of 481 million metric tons of SOC, 29\% and 109 million metric tons greater than the SSURGO baseline. We use these estimates to explore the use of the land cover based SOC values to project the impacts of likely land cover change by 2050.},

	abstract = {Soils contain a large and dynamic fraction of global terrestrial carbon stocks. The distribution of soil carbon (SC) with depth varies among ecosystems and land uses and is an important factor in calculating SC stocks and their vulnerabilities. Systematic analysis of SC depth distributions across databases of SC profiles has been challenging due to the heterogeneity of soil profile measurements, which vary in depth sampling. Here, we fit over 40,000 SC depth profiles to an exponential decline relationship with depth to determine SC concentration at the top of the mineral soil, minimum SC concentration at depth, and the characteristic “length” of SC concentration decline with depth. Fitting these parameters allowed profile characteristics to be analyzed across a large and heterogeneous dataset. We then assessed the differences in these depth parameters across soil orders and land cover types and between soil profiles with or without a history of tillage, as represented by the presence of an Ap horizon. We found that historically tilled soils had more gradual decreases of SC with depth (greater e-folding depth or Z∗), deeper SC profiles, lower SC concentrations at the top of the mineral soil, and lower total SC stocks integrated to 30 cm. The large database of profiles allowed these results to be confirmed across different land cover types and spatial areas within the Continental United States, providing robust evidence for systematic impacts of historical tillage on SC stocks and depth distributions.},

	abstract = {Most soils in the Midwestern USA have lost 30 to 50\% of their original pool, or 25 to 40 Mg C/ha, upon conversion from natural to agricultural ecosystems. About 60 to 70\% of the C thus depleted can be resequestered through adoption of recommended soil and crop management practices. These practices include conversion from plow till to no till, frequent use of winter cover crops in the rotation cycle, elimination of summer fallow, integrated nutrient management along with liberal use of biosolids and biological nitrogen fixation, precision farming to minimize losses and enhance fertilizer use efficiency, and use of improved varieties with ability to produce large root biomass with high content of lignin and suberin. The gross rate of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration ranges from 500 to 800 kg/ha/year in cold and humid regions and 100 to 300 kg/ha/year in dry and warm regions. The rate of SOC sequestration can be measured with procedures that are cost effective and credible at soil pedon level, landscape level, regional or national scale. In addition to SOC, there is also a large potential to sequester soil inorganic carbon (SIC) in arid and semi-arid regions. Soil C sequestration has numerous ancillary benefits. It is truly a win-win situation: extremely cost-effective, and a bridge to the future until alternative energy options take effect.},

We provide key information on the benefits of harmful algal bloom cleanup by linking housing transactions in 2003 to 2015 from seven Ohio counties bordering Lake Erie with measures of water quality using remote-sensing images. We further control for endogenous algae production using instrumental variables derived from hydrological processes that link Maumee River runoff to nutrient concentrations in Lake Erie. Using a semiparametric approach, we find the impact of harmful algal blooms on housing prices is spatially limited to properties within 1.2 km of Lake Erie. For the average near lake homeowner, a 1 μg/L increase in algae concentrations is expected to decrease property values by 1.7\% (\$2205). In aggregate, fulfilling the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement will provide a yearly benefit of up to \$42.9 million, fully covering the current annual expenditure on water quality improvement.},

Discharge, total phosphorus, dissolved reactive phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and chloride all recorded 33-year maximum loads, while the loads for nitrate ranked 5th (Sandusky) and 8th (Maumee) out of 33. Loads of particulate phosphorus ranked 2nd (Sandusky) and 4th (Maumee), and those for suspended solids ranked 10th (Sandusky) and 9th (Maumee). This is partly a consequence of total rainfall, which was the largest observed at the Tiffin weather station (Sandusky watershed) and nearly the largest at the Toledo station (Maumee watershed) during this period. It also results from other aspects of the weather in interaction with agricultural practices, notably a warm, wet fall and early winter. Longer-term trends were also significant factors for some parameters. The weather was the major factor responsible for these large loads. Regardless of cause, these loads represent a substantial loss of resources from agricultural fields in the watersheds. This loss could have been reduced by better management. Losses of sediment and phosphorus from these watersheds are higher than average for Midwestern agricultural watersheds, and losses of nitrogen are slightly above average. Based on winter 2008 fertilizer prices from local fertilizer dealers, replacing the nutrients lost from these watersheds in water year 2007 would cost more than \$80,000,000 or \$166 ha−1 (\$67 ac−1) for every field in the watershed receiving fertilizer in a given year.},

	abstract = {The major water quality impairment in the Midwest United States is sediment eroded from agricultural lands. Yet, few understand where or when erosion occurs, or the dynamics of soil erosion, the relative impact of precipitation, topography, land management and severe events over time and space. The objectives of this project are to: 1) develop methodology for estimating near real time spatial and temporal soil erosion and water runoff losses; and 2) explore issues in applying the method to a large area by setting up and running a prototype system for the state of Iowa. To accomplish this, soil erosion and water runoff loss are estimated daily at the township level (-10 by -10 km area) (-6.2 mi)2 and a map is posted on the Internet daily showing precipitation with runoff and soil erosion estimates for every Iowa township. We use Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), a daily simulation model, to compute soil erosion and surface runoff. WEPP uses accumulated precipitation by 15-minute periods obtained with NEXRAD radar. Other needed weather data are obtained from an Iowa weather network. The National Resources Inventory provides soil, topography, cropping and management information required for running WEPP. Daily and annual spatial precipitation, runoff and erosion estimates illustrate a high level of spatial variability related to topography, precipitation characteristics, soils and management practices.},

	abstract = {This paper uses Monte Carlo methods and regression analysis to assess the role of uncertainty in yield function and land supply elasticity parameters on land use, carbon, and market outcomes in a long-term dynamic model of the global forest sector. The results suggest that parametric uncertainty has little influence on projected future timber prices and global output, but it does have important implications for regional projections of outputs. A wide range of outcomes are possible for timber outputs, depending on growth and elasticity parameters. Timber output in the U.S., for instance, could change by -67 to +98 million m3 per year by 2060. Despite uncertainty in the parameters, our analysis suggests that the temperate zone may sequester +30 to +79 Pg C by 2060 and +58 to +114 Pg C by 2090 while the tropics are projected to store -35 to +70 Pg C and -33 to +73 Pg C for the same time periods, respectively. Attributional analysis shows that uncertainty in the parameters regulating forest growth has a more important impact on projections of future carbon storage than uncertainty in the land supply elasticity parameters. Moreover, the results suggest that understanding growth parameters in regions with large current carbon stocks is most important for making future projections of carbon storage.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how nutrient prices, weather, and other factors influenced P outputs in agricultural watersheds using a detailed daily dataset of water quality observations over a 40-year period. Because policies have focused differentially on soluble P through federal permitting programs for point sources and sediments through federal subsidies for conservation, we examine sediment, particulate P and soluble P separately. A novel element of this study is the inclusion of farm fertilizer and output (i.e., corn) prices, which affect agricultural sources of P in these watersheds. We do not find that sediment concentrations are influenced by P prices, but sediment has trended downward, and is seasonally lower in all months except February and March in the Maumee. In contrast, we find that soluble P concentrations are heavily influenced by P prices. They trended downward through 1995, but upwards since. While concerns about fall and winter P application have emerged, we do not find evidence that the distribution of soluble P concentrations shifted towards winter over time. Weather accounts for about 50\% of the higher soluble P loadings in 1996–2011, but higher P prices in 2005–2011 lowered P concentrations relative to what they would have been. Other factors account for the remaining 50\% of the increase in soluble P concentrations in 1996–2011.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how the demand for commodities adjusts to supply shocks, and shows the importance of capturing this adjustment process when calculating welfare effects. A dynamic capital adjustment model for U.S. softwood stumpage markets is developed, and compared to a traditional lagged adjustment model. The results show that timber markets in the U.S. adjusted to the large supply shock of the late 1980's over a 5 to 8 year period. Our short-run price elasticity estimates are similar to the existing literature, ranging from − 0.002 to − 0.253, although our estimates show that the demand is substantially more elastic in the long-run, with long-run elasticity estimates ranging from − 0.134 to − 0.506. If this adjustment in the demand function is taken into account when calculating welfare effects, the effects of the supply shock in timber markets of the late 1980's on consumer surplus declines by over 50\% compared to the estimated effects when using the short-run model, and the total welfare effects decline by 37\%.},

	abstract = {This paper assesses the impact of nutrient prices on nutrient concentrations in agricultural watersheds. Specifically, we find that the price elasticity of nutrient emissions from agricultural watersheds is −0.17 to −0.34, suggesting that a 10\% increase in nitrogen or phosphorus prices faced by farmers would lead to up to a 3.4\% reduction in nitrogen or phosphorus emissions from a watershed. While this sounds modest, it is about the same size as estimates of the price elasticity of nutrient demand by farmers, a relationship which also is very inelastic. Our results suggest that when prices for nutrients rise, there is a direct effect on nutrient emissions from watersheds. Given recent concerns about phosphorus in Lake Erie, we assess the potential implications of applying a phosphorus usage fee to reduce phosphorus emissions there. We find that a 25\% increase in phosphorus prices would reduce nutrient outputs from the three Lake Erie watersheds we modelled by 6.5\%, or 210t phosphorus per year, and cost about \$6ha−1yr−1. These costs are similar to estimates of the costs of reducing phosphorus through waste water treatment plants, and less than the costs of other widely used agricultural best management practices like cover crops.},

This work studies the effectiveness of local manure management regulations on dairy farms in Wisconsin. Wisconsin represents a unique policy experiment in the delegation of nonpoint agricultural pollution policy in a state with economically important small, nonpoint, dairy farms. Using hand collected regulatory data from Wisconsin counties we estimate the effects of changes in local regulations on water quality outcomes. The results demonstrate that a few easily implemented and verifiable regulations such as nutrient management plans have significant short-term effects on water quality, whereas other less observable and difficult to implement regulations have no discernible effects in the short term. The work points to a number of potential policy levers to improve the Management of nonpoint pollution, as well as the challenges of nonpoint source regulatory policies on slow-moving hydrologic processes.},

	abstract = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) storage is an indicator of environmental quality for mineral soils because of the influence that organic matter has on key functional properties, such as fertility, soil structure and water relations. Historically, agricultural management has caused large losses of SOC relative to native ecosystems, leading to degradation. However, new technologies and conservation practices have been developed during the past few decades that can enhance SOC storage, and thus improve environmental quality. Our objective was to describe a national inventory procedure to estimate SOC storage for purposes of monitoring environmental quality. The major steps in this procedure include: (1) model selection/development, (2) model verification, (3) identification of model input data, (4) uncertainty assessment, (5) model implementation, and (6) validation of results. Applying this approach With a simple C accounting method, the upper 30 cm of US agricultural soils were estimated to have accumulated 10.8 Tg C yr(-1) between 1982 and 1997, with an uncertainty of +/- 40\%. A simple index was developed to relate estimated SOC stocks to the potential amounts under native conditions and conventional agricultural management. An index value of 0\% on the proposed scale would be equivalent to the SOC under conventional agricultural use, while an index value of 100\% would be equivalent to native levels. With an estimated 1997 stock of 22400 Tg C, the index value for US agricultural soils was about 60\%. Using this inventory procedure, environmental issues related to soil, water and air quality could be informed by SOC in combination with other key indicators, in addition to using the inventory for evaluating sustainability of agricultural lands for food and fiber production.},

In this paper, we focus on staggered DID (also referred as event studies) and discuss the role played by the PTA in terms of identification and estimation of causal parameters. We document a “robustness” versus “efficiency” trade-off in terms of the strength of the underlying PTA and argue that practitioners should be explicit about these trade-offs whenever using DID procedures. We propose new DID estimators that reflect these trade-offs and derive their large sample properties.

We define a class of linear instrumental variables estimators that rely on Euler equations expressed in terms of conditional choice probabilities (ECCP estimators). These estimators do not require observing or modeling the agent’s entire information set, nor solving or simulating a dynamic program. As such, they are simple to implement and computationally light. We provide constructive arguments for the identification of model primitives, and establish the estimator’s consistency and asymptotic normality. Four applied examples serve to illustrate the ECCP approach’s implementation, advantages, and limitations: dynamic demand for durable goods, agricultural land use change, technology adoption, and dynamic labor supply. We illustrate the estimator’s good finite-sample performance in a Monte Carlo study, and we estimate a labor supply model empirically for taxi drivers in New York City.},

While it can be prevented with the appropriate supplement or food fortification, these programs struggle to reach the poorest, out-of-school children, men and the elderly. This paper reports on the impact of a potential strategy to address iron deficiency anemia in rural areas: salt fortified with iron and iodine (DFS). We conduct a large-scale experiment in 400 villages in Bihar to test the impacts of both selling DFS and giving it away for free. At baseline, 45\% of the sample is anemic. In 200 randomly assigned villages, we introduce DFS for the first time at half the normal retail price and sell it for roughly 30 months. In 62 of those sales villages, we deliver DFS for free directly to 7 randomly assigned households over nearly 24 months. We find no evidence that either selling DFS or providing it for free has an economically meaningful or statistically significant impact on hemoglobin, anemia, physical health, cognition or mental health. For the sales experiment, we can reject a reduction of 2.4 percent in the fraction anemic in the entire sample and 1 percent among those who were previously anemic. Using an IV strategy, we find a statistically significant, though relatively small, increase in hemoglobin and reduction in the fraction anemic for adolescents, a subgroup that responded well to supplements and fortification in earlier studies. These disappointing results are explained both by modest purchases and low impact of DFS for the majority of the population, even when consumed somewhat regularly.},

	abstract = {In the evaluation of public programs, experimental designs are rare. Researchers instead rely on observational designs. Observational designs that use panel data are widely portrayed as superior to time-series or cross-sectional designs because they provide opportunities to control for observable and unobservable variables correlated with outcomes and exposure to a program. The most popular panel data evaluation designs use linear, fixed-effects estimators with additive individual and time effects. To assess the ability of observational designs to replicate results from experimental designs, scholars use design replications. No such replications have assessed popular, fixed-effects panel data models that exploit repeated observations before and after treatment assignment. We implement such a study using, as a benchmark, results from a randomized environmental program that included effective and ineffective treatments. The popular linear, fixed-effects estimator fails to generate impact estimates or statistical inferences similar to the experimental estimator. Applying common flexible model specifications or trimming procedures also fail to yield accurate estimates or inferences. However, following best practices for selecting a nonexperimental comparison group and combining matching methods with panel data estimators, we replicate the experimental benchmarks. We demonstrate how the combination of panel and matching methods mitigates common concerns about specifying the correct functional form, the nature of treatment effect heterogeneity, and the way in which time enters the model. Our results are consistent with recent claims that design trumps methods in estimating treatment effects and that combining designs is more likely to approximate a randomized controlled trial than applying a single design.},

In its basic version, a “control group” is untreated at two dates, whereas a “treatment group” becomes fully treated at the second date. However, in many applications of the DID method, the treatment rate only increases more in the treatment group. In such fuzzy designs, a popular estimator of the treatment effect is the DID of the outcome divided by the DID of the treatment. We show that this ratio identifies a local average treatment effect only if the effect of the treatment is stable over time, and if the effect of the treatment is the same in the treatment and in the control group. We then propose two alternative estimands that do not rely on any assumption on treatment effects, and that can be used when the treatment rate does not change over time in the control group. We prove that the corresponding estimators are asymptotically normal. Finally, we use our results to reassess the returns to schooling in Indonesia.},

We show that a family of causal effect parameters are identified in staggered DiD setups, even if differences in observed characteristics create non-parallel outcome dynamics between groups. Our identification results allow one to use outcome regression, inverse probability weighting, or doubly-robust estimands. We also propose different aggregation schemes that can be used to highlight treatment effect heterogeneity across different dimensions as well as to summarize the overall effect of participating in the treatment. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and prove the validity of a computationally convenient bootstrap procedure to conduct asymptotically valid simultaneous (instead of pointwise) inference.

We also derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the ATT in DID designs when either panel or repeated cross-section data are available, and show that our proposed estimators attain the semiparametric efficiency bound when the working models are correctly specified. Furthermore, we quantify the potential efficiency gains of having access to panel data instead of repeated cross-section data. Finally, by paying particular attention to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters, we show that one can sometimes construct doubly robust DID estimators for the ATT that are also doubly robust for inference.

	abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

	abstract = {Nearest-neighbor matching is a popular nonparametric tool to create balance between treatment and control groups in observational studies. As a preprocessing step before regression, matching reduces the dependence on parametric modeling assumptions. In current empirical practice, however, the matching step is often ignored in the calculation of standard errors and confidence intervals. In this article, we show that ignoring the matching step results in asymptotically valid standard errors if matching is done without replacement and the regression model is correctly specified relative to the population regression function of the outcome variable on the treatment variable and all the covariates used for matching. However, standard errors that ignore the matching step are not valid if matching is conducted with replacement or, more crucially, if the second step regression model is misspecified in the sense indicated above. Moreover, correct specification of the regression model is not required for consistent estimation of treatment effects with matched data. We show that two easily implementable alternatives produce approximations to the distribution of the post-matching estimator that are robust to misspecification. A simulation study and an empirical example demonstrate the empirical relevance of our results. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In this paper, we focus on staggered DID (also referred as event-studies) and discuss the role played by the PTA in terms of identification and estimation of causal parameters. We document a ``robustness'' vs. ``efficiency'' trade-off in terms of the strength of the underlying PTA, and argue that practitioners should be explicit about these trade-offs whenever using DID procedures. We propose new DID estimators that reflect these trade-offs and derived their large sample properties. We illustrate the practical relevance of these results by assessing whether the transition from federal to state management of the Clean Water Act affects compliance rates.},

	abstract = {Loading rates of the herbicides atrazine, alachlor, cyanazine, metolachlor, and metribuzin to western and central Lake Erie for the period 1983–1993 were determined for the Raisin, Maumee, Sandusky, Cuyahoga, and Grand River tributaries. Knowledge of these loads is important as input: (1) to the development and refinement of the Lakewide Management Plans (LAMPs); (2) to understand the dynamics of these herbicides in the Great Lakes for the prediction of their effects on human and ecosystem health; and (3) for the comparative assessment of agricultural pollution and its management on a regional and national scale. Loads were calculated using a new implementation of the Beale Ratio Estimator. Variability in annual loads is substantial, and is linked to year-to-year differences in rainfall and river discharge, particularly during the several months following herbicide application. The highest loads were observed in 1990, and the lowest loads in the drought year of 1988; the highest annual loads exceeded the lowest by as much as 60-fold. The Sandusky and Maumee rivers have substantially higher unit area loads than the other tributaries, reflecting the extent of row crop agriculture in these basins and their propensity toward surface runoff of precipitation because of fine-grained soils. For the Maumee and Sandusky rivers, atrazine and metolachlor loads are typically in the range 2–5 g/ha/yr, and infrequently reach 9–12 g/ha/yr. Alachlor loads are typically in the range 1–2 g/ha/yr and have not exceeded 4 g/ha/yr during the period of record. Cyanazine and metribuzin loads are typically less than 1.5 g/ha/yr, and rarely exceed 2 g/ha/yr. Loads in the Cuyahoga and Raisin rivers are typically less than 1 g/ha/yr.,with atrizine the highest, typically about 1 g/ha/yr and rarely reaching 3 g/ha/yr. Herbicides are infrequently detected in the Grand River, and loads are low and estimated with considerable uncertainty. Total loads for the five stations combined range from 500–20,000 kg/yr and 600–14,000 kg/yr for atrazine and metolachlor to 100–6,000 kg/yr for alachlor, 70–3,300 kg/yr for cyanazine, and 60–2,800 kg/yr for metribuzin.},

	abstract = {Estimation of sediment and nutrient loads is of crucial interest for a good assessment of water pollution. This paper proposes an overview of existing estimation methods and a framework to select the most suited one given available streamflow and concentration data. Correlations between contaminant concentration and streamflow should first be checked to generate missing concentration values by regression. However, correlations are not always strong, in which case the ratio estimator method is more appropriate. Given a 6-year data set (1989–1995) from the Beaurivage River (Québec, Canada) with, at best, a weekly sampling, the ratio estimator method was selected to estimate annual and seasonal loads of sediments and nutrients (N and P). Results show relatively steady annual loads (on average 8.1 and 1.1kghayr−1 for total dissolved N and total P, respectively) and a low erosion rate (0.23thayr−1). The results also confirm that nutrient and sediment transport via runoff is essentially a springtime process in this region, and they indicate that dissolved P represents the bulk of the total P load, most likely due to artificial subsurface drainage systems in the watershed. These results are compared to the results obtained by using averaging methods and to several other sources of information from literature, confirming the order of magnitude but highlighting some remaining uncertainties. Finally, some research avenues are proposed to improve the proposed framework and to investigate other estimation methods adapted to data characteristics.},

Previous studies aimed at addressing non-point source pollution have primarily analyzed the effectiveness of conservation practices (CPs) as land-management strategies. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of these practices have not been compared to those of possible land-use changes. We develop a spatially explicit integrated modeling approach that compares the effectiveness and economic efficiency of alternative spatially optimal land-use and -management strategies for P abatement in the Sandusky River watershed. Using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool and data on costs and profits from crop and forest production and urban development, we evaluated joint impacts on P reduction and economic-returns for optimized land-use changes and/or implementation of CPs in the watershed. Results showed a combination of both CPs and land-use changes are likely required to meet current abatement targets for dissolved reactive phosphorus. Additionally, the combination of these approaches can generate a positive, synergistic effect on economic efficiency in meeting key policy targets. This is largely because the combined strategy will establish CPs on the most productive cropland, while achieving greater nutrient reduction through land-use change away from corn-soybean rotations on less productive lands.},

Estimation is implemented using a modified version of the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm that allows for fast estimation in the presence of HDFE. Because the code is built around the reghdfe package (Correia, 2014, Statistical Software Components S457874, Department of Economics, Boston Col- lege), it has similar syntax, supports many of the same functionalities, and benefits from reghdfe’s fast convergence properties for computing high-dimensional least- squares problems. Performance is further enhanced by some new techniques we introduce for accelerating HDFE iteratively reweighted least-squares estimation specifically. ppmlhdfe also implements a novel and more robust approach to check for the existence of (pseudo)maximum likelihood estimates.},

	abstract = {Endogeneity is often present in discrete choice models, precluding the consistent estimation of the model parameters. To correct for this problem, the researcher needs to gather exogenous instrumental variables, which should be independent of the error term of the model. This critical assumption can be tested using overidentification tests that rely on having more instruments than endogenous variables. For discrete choice models, instruments’ exogeneity can be assessed using the Amemiya-Lee-Newey test, which relies in the estimation of an auxiliary GMM model build from reduced-form estimates. This paper proposes two alternative tests that are constructed as adaptations of the Refutability test and the Hausman test, into the discrete choice framework. The Refutability test consists in including instruments as additional variables in an auxiliary model that was corrected for endogeneity using all instruments available. The Hausman test is built from the comparison of the estimates attained using different subsets of instruments. Using a binary choice Monte Carlo experiment, the three tests are assessed in terms of size, power, and robustness to De Blander's condition for which all overidentification tests of this kind are blind. Results show that what is termed the modified Refutability test, which includes all instruments simultaneously, has smaller size distortion, larger power, and more robustness, compared to the state of the art Amemiya-Lee-Newey test and to the proposed Hausman test. Besides, the Amemiya-Lee-Newey and both versions of the Refutability test allow being agnostic about which instrument might be exogenous. The paper finishes highlighting the methodological and practical implications and limitations of these findings and suggesting future lines of research in this area.},

In addition to environmental and ecological factors, angler choices may influence recreational catches. Using interviews (92,838) from Walleye Sander vitreus anglers in Lake Erie during 1989–2017, we identified how angler behavior influences catch outcomes. Angler behaviors were associated with changes in catch rate and the length of harvested fish. For example, trolling resulted in a 50\% increase in median catch and a 24-mm increase in length, relative to casting. Other behaviors led to tradeoffs between catch rate and size, such as the time of year anglers fished. We identified behaviors that maximize fishing success with respect to anglers’ desired catch outcomes. Our results can help increase angler satisfaction by providing realistic catch expectations, given the environmental and fishery conditions, while improving recreational catch outcomes through more informed angler decision making.},

	abstract = {Blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa, have been both a public health and ecological concern in Lake Erie for over a decade. Although models were previously developed to forecast cyanobacterial bloom severity, the recent few years of bloom severity observations indicate the need to update these empirical models. The models that best estimate the bloom biomass use the Maumee River discharge or total bioavailable phosphorus (TBP) loading from March through July. TBP is the sum of the dissolved reactive phosphorus and the proportion of particulate phosphorus that is bioavailable, corrected for loss due to settling in the river. In years when average June water temperatures were too low for Microcystis growth ({\textless}17°C), the July loads were excluded. As total phosphorus (TP) load includes much phosphorus that is not bioavailable (or reaches the lake), the load of TBP was considered, and it provided a model that better explained the blooms than the TP load. Residual discrepancies between predicted and observed blooms may involve factors such as the timing of the majority of the spring loads (e.g., most in March or most in June or July) and potential influence from an extremely large bloom in the previous year. The most extreme loads, such as seen in 2015, may cause different responses than more moderate loads. The models estimate bloom size in most scenarios observed and can serve as the foundation for setting nutrient reduction targets to decrease the occurrence of blooms in western Lake Erie.},

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a recurring problem in many temperate large lake and coastal marine ecosystems, caused mainly by anthropogenic eutrophication. Implementation of agricultural conservation practices (ACPs) offers a means to reduce non-point source nutrient runoff and mitigate HABs. However, the effectiveness of ACPs in a changing climate remains uncertain. We used an integrated biophysical modeling approach to predict how Lake Erie cyanobacterial HAB severity (bloom biomass) may change under several climate and ACP implementation scenarios, using western Lake Erie and its largely agricultural watershed as our study system. An ensemble of general circulation model projections was used to drive spatially explicit land use and hydrology models of the Maumee River watershed, the output of which informed a predictive model of Lake Erie HAB severity. Results show that, in the absence of changes in ACPs, the frequency of severe HABs is projected to increase during coming decades, owing to increased inputs of nutrients from the watershed. These anticipated increases are due to increased total precipitation and more frequent higher-magnitude rainfall events. While further implementation of ACPs appears capable of reducing severe HAB events, widespread implementation would be necessary to reduce HAB severity below current management targets. This study highlights how continued climate change will only exacerbate the need for land management practices that can reduce nutrient runoff in agriculturally dominated ecosystems, such as Lake Erie. It also shows how interdisciplinary, biophysical modeling approaches can help identify strategies to mitigate HABs in the face of anthropogenic stressors.},

The detection algorithm uses an approximation of the second derivative as a measure of spectral shape around the 681 nm band S 2d(681). With the end of the MERIS mission on 8 April 2012, an analogue was developed for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to continue monitoring for these blooms. The MODIS analogue uses the standard ρs (Rayleigh-corrected reflectance) to determine S 2d(678), which is computationally equivalent to the negative of the MODIS fluorescent line height (FLH). A comparison was made of the two products from image pairs during a period of relatively severe blooms of cyanobacteria (2008–2011). When the MODIS bands do not saturate due to surface scums from high cyanobacteria biomass or conditions of glint or dense aerosols, the algorithms produce comparable results with a linear transform of the MODIS S 2d(678). The results indicate that MODIS can be used to monitor these blooms. Dense cyanobacteria blooms will produce negative FLH showing a limitation of FLH for bloom detection. The S 2d(678) offers a tool to support monitoring for dense algal blooms.},

The bloom season according to the satellite observations falls within June 1 and October 31. Maps show the pattern of development and areas most commonly impacted during all years (with minor and severe blooms). Frequencies during years with just severe blooms (minor bloom years were not included in the analysis) were examined in the same fashion.

The bloom was first identified by satellite on 14 August 2008 and persisted for {\textgreater} 2 months. The distribution and intensity of the bloom was estimated using a satellite algorithm that is sensitive to near-surface concentrations of M. aeruginosa. Increases in both area and intensity were most pronounced for wind stress {\textless} 0.05 Pa. Area increased while intensity did not change for wind stresses of 0.05-0.1 Pa, and both decreased for wind stress {\textgreater} 0.1 Pa. The recovery in intensity at the surface after strong wind events indicated that high wind stress mixed the bloom through the water column and that it returned to the surface once mixing stopped. This interaction is consistent with the understanding of the buoyancy of these blooms. Cloud cover (reduced light) may have a weak influence on intensity during calm conditions. While water temperature remained {\textgreater} 15°C, the bloom intensified if there were calm conditions. For water temperature {\textless} 15°C, the bloom subsided under similar conditions. As a result, wind stress needs to be considered when interpreting satellite imagery of these blooms.},

Estimation is implemented using a modiﬁed version of the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm that allows for fast estimation in the presence of HDFE. Because the code is built around the reghdfe package (Correia, 2014, Statistical Software Components S457874, Department of Economics, Boston College), it has similar syntax, supports many of the same functionalities, and beneﬁts from reghdfe’s fast convergence properties for computing high-dimensional leastsquares problems. Performance is further enhanced by some new techniques we introduce for accelerating HDFE iteratively reweighted least-squares estimation speciﬁcally. ppmlhdfe also implements a novel and more robust approach to check for the existence of (pseudo)maximum likelihood estimates.},

Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated.

It leads to inconsistency with standard estimation methods that maintain independence between the model's error and the included variables. The authors describe a control function approach for handling endogeneity in choice models. Observed variables and economic theory are used to derive controls for the dependence between the endogenous variable and the demand error. The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pricing equation and the advertising equation. The authors? approach is an alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market controls for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to examine households? choices among television options, including basic and premium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price. Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates that are similar.},

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Western Basin (WB) of Lake Erie have been linked to nonpoint pollution from agricultural watersheds. The Maumee River watershed is the largest in the Great Lakes region and delivers the biggest sediment and nutrient load to Lake Erie.
Study focus
Climate change could alter the magnitude and timing of sediment and nutrient delivery to Lake Erie's WB. Data from four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models were inputted into a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Maumee River watershed to determine the effects of climate change on watershed yields. Tillage practices were also altered within the model to test the effectiveness of conservation practices under climate change scenarios.
New hydrological insights for the region
Moderate climate change scenarios reduced annual flow (up to −24\%) and sediment (up to −26\%) yields, while a more extreme scenario showed smaller flow reductions (up to −10\%) and an increase in sediment (up to +11\%). No-till practices had a negligible effect on flow but produced 16\% lower average sediment loads than scenarios using current watershed conditions. At high implementation rates, no-till practices could offset any future increases in annual sediment loads, but they may have varied seasonal success. Regardless of future climate change intensity, increased remediation efforts will likely be necessary to significantly reduce HABs in Lake Erie's WB.},

The empirical framework includes econometric models that predict land conversion and crop choices at the parcel level based on expectation and variance of crop revenues, land quality, climate conditions, and physical characteristics at each site. The predictions are then combined with site-specific environmental production functions to determine the effect of revenue insurance on nitrate runoff and leaching, soil water and wind erosion, and carbon sequestration. Results suggest that federal crop insurance has, on average, a small effect on conversions of non-cropland to cropland, and somewhat more significant impacts on crop choice and crop rotation. These changes in cropping systems have, on average, small impacts on agricultural pollution.},

Yet to date, the full potential of natural systems to store carbon has not been leveraged because policymakers have required long-term contracts to compensate for permanence concerns, and these long-term contracts substantially raise costs and limit deployment. In this paper, we lay out the rationale that our time preference for early action leads to the conclusion that multiple tons of short-term storage of carbon in ecosystem stocks can be considered to have equal value – as measured by the social cost of carbon – as 1 ton of carbon sequestered permanently. This equivalence can be used to quantify the value of short-term carbon storage, thereby removing one of the most significant barriers to participation in the carbon market and enabling the full climate mitigation potential of the land sector to be realized.},

One reason for this omission is that congestion is determined in equilibrium by the process of individuals sorting across sites and thus presents significant endogeneity problems. This paper illustrates this source of endogeneity, describes how previous research has dealt with it using stated preference techniques, and describes an instrumental variables approach to address it in a revealed preference context. We demonstrate that failing to address the endogeneity of congestion leads one to dramatically understate its costs. We apply our technique to the valuation of a large recreational fishing site in Wisconsin (Lake Winnebago) which, if eliminated, would induce significant re-sorting of anglers amongst remaining sites. Ignoring congestion leads to an understatement of the lake's value by more than 50\%.},

	abstract = {When assessing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and its climate change (CC) mitigation potential at global scale, the dynamic nature of soil carbon storage and interventions to foster it should be taken into account. Firstly, adoption of SOC-sequestration measures will take time, and reasonably such schemes could only be implemented gradually at large-scale. Secondly, if soils are managed as carbon sinks, then SOC will increase only over a limited time, up to the point when a new SOC equilibrium is reached. This paper combines these two processes and predicts potential SOC sequestration dynamics in agricultural land at global scale and the corresponding CC mitigation potential. Assuming that global governments would agree on a worldwide effort to gradually change land use practices towards turning agricultural soils into carbon sinks starting 2014, the projected 87-year (2014–2100) global SOC sequestration potential of agricultural land ranged between 31 and 64 Gt. This is equal to 1.9–3.9\% of the SRES-A2 projected 87-year anthropogenic emissions. SOC sequestration would peak 2032–33, at that time reaching 4.3–8.9\% of the projected annual SRES-A2 emission. About 30 years later the sequestration rate would have reduced by half. Thus, SOC sequestration is not a C wedge that could contribute increasingly to mitigating CC. Rather, the mitigation potential is limited, contributing very little to solving the climate problem of the coming decades. However, we deliberately did not elaborate on the importance of maintaining or increasing SOC for sustaining soil health, agro-ecosystem functioning and productivity; an issue of global significance that deserves proper consideration irrespectively of any potential additional sequestration of SOC.},

We use a multinomial logit model to estimate the land use shares of forests, crops and urban in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. The results show that marketed environmental rents increase forestland relative to cropland. To examine the effects of biofuels on land use, we conduct policy analysis by altering future land rents. Our baseline scenario projects that urban development uses mostly cropland, but with higher crop rents resulting from increased demand for bioenergy, there will be significant losses of forestland to urban and cropland. On the other hand, if marketed environmental rents grow while crop rents are maintained at their baseline value, urban growth will occur, primarily at the expense of cropland.},

To conduct this analysis, researchers developed a new, global, dynamic partial equilibrium model of agricultural and forested land uses. Global consumption for each product is the sum of regional production, and there is a single global price trend for each commodity. Timber outputs are substitutable across regions, and quality adjustment factors account for differences in timber quality by region and species. The land and feed CES function is then used as an input into the upper level livestock production function. The supply side of the land market is modeled via a constant elasticity of transformation (CET) function. The data for the crop and livestock sectors is derived from GTAP version 6, representing the world economy in 2001.},

Using data from the U.S. Census of Agriculture, we find that fallow is an important adaption strategy for wheat farms in the U.S. Pacific Northwest region. In particular, we find that a warmer and wetter climate increases the share of fallow in total cropland and thus reduces cropland in production. Our simulations project that, on average by 2050, the share of fallow (1.5 million acres in 2012) in the U.S. Pacific Northwest region will increase by 1.3\% (0.12 million acres) under a medium climate change scenario and by 1.8\% (0.16 million acres) under a high climate change scenario.},

	abstract = {A global validation database that can be used to assess the accuracy of multiple global and regional land-cover maps would yield significant cost savings and enhance comparisons of accuracy of different maps. Because the global validation database should expand over time as new validation data are contributed, the sampling design must be constructed so that it is simple to increase the sample size from a specific region (e.g. a continent or country) or from targeted land-cover classes to improve standard errors of the accuracy estimates. Stratified random sampling provides the desired adaptability to augment a sample to address regional or class-specific accuracy objectives. The proposed global validation database will be initiated from a baseline global stratified sample and then this baseline sample will be augmented to address accuracy objectives related to a specific map or region. The strata are constructed from a modified Köppen climate classification and population density. The theory and formulas for estimating accuracy from the combined baseline and augmented stratified samples are presented, and an example application is provided in which the regional accuracy of a land-cover map is assessed. The stratification used for the baseline global sample is retained when the augmented sample is subsequently selected. Alternatively, it is possible to ‘restratify’ the design so that the land-cover classes of a particular map are used as strata when selecting an augmented sample. The protocol for restratifying the design is presented, but the complexity of this option makes it less practical than retaining the initial strata when selecting an augmented sample.},

We derived two maps approximating global land cover that would exist for current climate in the absence of human disturbance of the landscape, using a procedure that minimizes disagreements between maps of existing and natural vegetation that represent artifacts in the data. Similarly, we simulated monthly fields of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, required as input to CASA, for the undisturbed land cover case. Model results estimate total carbon losses from human-induced land cover changes of 182 and 199 Pg for the two simulations, compared with an estimate of 124 Pg for total flux between 1850 and 1990 [Houghton, 1999], suggesting that land cover change prior to 1850 accounted for approximately one-third of total carbon emissions from land use change. Estimates of global carbon loss from the two independence methods, the modeling approach used in this paper and the accounting approach of Houghton [1999], are comparable taking into account carbon losses from agricultural expansion prior to 1850 estimated at 48-57 Pg. However, estimates of regional carbon losses vary considerably, notably in temperate midlatitudes where our estimates indicate higher cumulative carbon loss. Overall, land cover changes reduced global annual net primary productivity (NPP) by approximately 5\%, with large regional variations. High-input agriculture in North America and Europe display higher annual NPP than the natural vegetation that would exist in the absence of cropland. However, NPP has been depleted in localized areas in South Asia and Africa by up to 90\%. These results provide initial crude estimates, limited by the spatial resolution of the data sets used as input to the model and by the lack of information about transient changes in land cover.

	abstract = {Designing landscapes that can meet human needs, while maintaining functioning ecosystems, is essential for long-term sustainability. To achieve this goal, we must better understand the trade-offs and thresholds in the provision of ecosystem services and economic returns. To this end, we integrate spatially explicit economic and biophysical models to jointly optimize agricultural profit (sugarcane production and cattle ranching), biodiversity (bird and mammal species), and freshwater quality (nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment retention) in the Brazilian Cerrado. We generate efficiency frontiers to evaluate the economic and environmental trade-offs and map efficient combinations of agricultural land and natural habitat under varying service importance. To assess the potential impact of the Brazilian Forest Code (FC), a federal policy that aims to promote biodiversity and ecosystem services on private lands, we compare the frontiers with optimizations that mimic the habitat requirements in the region. We find significant opportunities to improve both economic and environmental outcomes relative to the current landscape. Substantial trade-offs between biodiversity and water quality exist when land use planning targets a single service, but these trade-offs can be minimized through multi-objective planning. We also detect non-linear profit-ecosystem services relationships that result in land use thresholds that coincide with the FC requirements. Further, we demonstrate that landscape-level planning can greatly improve the performance of the FC relative to traditional farm-level planning. These findings suggest that through joint planning for economic and environmental goals at a landscape-scale, Brazil's agricultural sector can expand production and meet regulatory requirements, while maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.},

An instrumental-variables approach is developed to address potential endogeneity bias in the water-clarity variable. Three lake-based physical variables serve as instrumental variables: total nitrogen concentration in lake water, total phosphorus concentration in lake water, and water temperature near the lake surface. The econometric results include three methodological findings: the instruments are valid and strong; the ordinary-least-squares estimate of the coefficient on the water-clarity variable is unbiased; and water clarity is the attribute of water quality valued in the housing market. The estimated water-clarity effect shows that a one-tenth of a meter change in water clarity leads to a one-percent change in housing price, or an elasticity of 0.20 at mean clarity. Coupling this effect with estimates of an ecological production function, a lake-specific benefit index is developed that shows the effect on housing values of bringing lakes into compliance with the US Environmental Protection Agency's regional recommendations for phosphorous concentration in lake waters.},

	abstract = {Changes in climate during the 20th century differ from region to region across the United States. We provide strong evidence that spatial variations in US temperature trends are linked to the hydrologic cycle, and we also present unique information on the seasonal and latitudinal structure of the linkage. We show that there is a statistically significant inverse relationship between trends in daily temperature and average daily precipitation across regions. This linkage is most pronounced in the southern United States (30–40°N) during the May-June time period and, to a lesser extent, in the northern United States (40–50°N) during the July-August time period. It is strongest in trends in maximum temperatures (Tmax) and 90th percentile exceedance trends (90PET), and less pronounced in the Tmax 10PET and the corresponding Tmin statistics, and it is robust to changes in analysis period. Although previous studies suggest that areas of increased precipitation may have reduced trends in temperature compared with drier regions, a change in sign from positive to negative trends suggests some additional cause. We show that trends in precipitation may account for some, but not likely all, of the cause point to evidence that shows that dynamical patterns (El Niño/Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, etc.) cannot account for the observed effects during May-June. We speculate that changing aerosols, perhaps related to vegetation changes, and increased strength of the aerosol direct and indirect effect may play a role in the observed linkages between these indices of temperature change and the hydrologic cycle.},

	abstract = {Watershed modeling in 20 large, United States (U.S.) watersheds addresses gaps in our knowledge of streamflow, nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus), and sediment loading sensitivity to mid-21st Century climate change and urban/residential development scenarios. Use of a consistent methodology facilitates regional scale comparisons across the study watersheds. Simulations use the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Climate change scenarios are from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program dynamically downscaled climate model output. Urban and residential development scenarios are from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios project. Simulations provide a plausible set of streamflow and water quality responses to mid-21st Century climate change across the U.S. Simulated changes show a general pattern of decreasing streamflow volume in the central Rockies and Southwest, and increases on the East Coast and Northern Plains. Changes in pollutant loads follow a similar pattern but with increased variability. Ensemble mean results suggest that by the mid-21st Century, statistically significant changes in streamflow and total suspended solids loads (relative to baseline conditions) are possible in roughly 30-40\% of study watersheds. These proportions increase to around 60\% for total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads. Projected urban/residential development, and watershed responses to development, are small at the large spatial scale of modeling in this study.},

	abstract = {Use of a single factor for converting soil organic carbon to soil organic matter is challenged. The basis for this challenge arises from four sources: the original papers published in the nineteenth century, empirical studies published throughout the twentieth century, theoretical considerations of organic matter composition, and a consideration of what led to the popularity and general acceptance of the conventional factor. The conventional factor of 1.724, based on the assumption that soil organic matter contains 58\% carbon, applies only to some soils or only to particular components of soil organic matter. Studies published since the end of the nineteenth century have consistently shown that the factor of 1.724 is too low for most soils. In a review of previously published data, the median value for the conversion factor was found to be 1.9 from empirical studies and 2 from more theoretical considerations. A factor of 2, based on the assumption that organic matter is 50\% carbon, would in almost all cases be more accurate than the conventional factor of 1.724. A consideration of the possible variation in organic matter composition predicts a range of factor values between 1.4 and 2.5, a range that is narrower than empirical results at least in part because of the interaction between the methods used to estimate organic matter and soil composition. Convenience, authority, and tradition rather than strength of evidence are in large part responsible for the widespread acceptance of the conventional factor.},

For this purpose, Landsat satellite and EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer data were acquired over agricultural fields in central Ohio, near Columbus, in April and May. According to the calculated mean normalized difference tillage index data (NDTI), in the period 2003 to 2014, area of conservation tillage fields increased at a rate of 8.41 \%, while no-tillage fields decreased at a rate of 14.45 \%. Comparing normalized difference index (NDI) data from 2003 and in 2014 it was determined that a reduction of 10\% vegetated areas occurred. Normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NSDVI) values did not evidence significant change over a nearly 10 year period. The best determination of tillage practices was obtained using the cellulose absorption index (CAI) value calculated from Hyperspectral data. By combining information on crop classification with indexes, similar results were obtained for crop distribution over a ten year period.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to predict and map SOC stocks at different depth intervals within the upper 1-m depth using profile depth distribution functions and ordinary kriging. These approaches were tested for the state of Indiana as a case study. A total of 464 pedons representing 204 soil series was obtained from the National Soil Survey Center database. Another 48 soil profile samples were collected to better represent the heterogeneity of the environmental variables. Two methods were used to model the depth distribution of the SOC stocks using negative exponential profile depth functions. In Procedure A, the functions to describe the depth distribution of volumetric C content for each soil profile were fitted using nonlinear least squares. In Procedure B, the exponential functions were fitted to describe the depth distribution of the cumulative SOC stocks. The parameters of the functions were interpolated for the entire study area using ordinary kriging on 81\% of the data points (n = 414). The integral of the exponential function up to the desired depth was used to predict SOC stocks within the 0- to 1-, 0- to 0.5-, and 0.5- to 1-m depth intervals. These estimates were validated using the remaining 19\% (n = 98) of the data. Procedure B showed a higher prediction accuracy for all depths, with higher r and lower RMSE values. The highest prediction accuracy (r = 0.75, RMSE = 2.89 kg m−2) was obtained for SOC stocks in the 0- to 0.5-m depth interval. Using Procedure B, SOC stocks within the top 1 m of Indiana soils were estimated to be 0.90 Pg C.},

	abstract = {Data mining from existing County soil surveys can improve the utility of maps for research, management and decision making. Aggregated soil series information in soil survey map units can be disaggregated by following a possibilistic decision tree approach to provide maps at the soil series level. The “overall map unit composition percentage” available in the soil survey tabular data can be treated as a possibility distribution of the prevalence of different soil series within all occurrences of the map unit in the survey area. A case study was conducted in Monroe County in southeastern Ohio. Three different learning approaches including C4.5 decision trees, nonspecificity based possibilistic decision trees and clustering based possibilistic decision trees were applied to the existent County survey, and the efficiency of predicting soils at the series level was assessed using an independent soil series point data set. The results showed an improvement in prediction accuracy by following the clustered possibilistic decision tree approach. The maps were useful in identifying the locations of component soil series within map unit associations, consociations, and complexes. Data mining from existent soil survey maps using the component information available in the tabular data can serve as a guide for disaggregating soil map units to create soil series maps, identifying misplacement of polygon boundaries, identifying presence of inclusions, and correcting mislabeled polygons, when updating soil surveys.},

	abstract = {Regional-scale assessment of soil C pools is essential to provide information for C cycling models, land management, and policy decisions, and elucidate the relative contribution of different C pools to total C (TC). We estimated TC and four soil C fractions, namely recalcitrant C (RC), hydrolyzable C (HC), hot-water-soluble C (SC), and mineralizable C (MC), at 0 to 30 cm across a 3585-km2 mixed-use watershed in north-central Florida. We used lognormal block kriging (BK) and regression block kriging (RK) to upscale soil C using 102 training samples and compared the models using 39 validation samples. Regression kriging produced the most accurate models for TC and RC, whereas the labile C fractions (HC, SC, and MC) were best modeled by BK. Maps produced by BK showed similar spatial patterns due to the strong correlation between the labile C fractions and the similarity of their spatial dependence structure. Estimates of TC and RC were similar due to their high correlation and the similarity of their global trend models. Total soil C amounted to 27.40 Tg across the watershed, indicating the potential of these soils to store C. Recalcitrant C totaled 22.49 Tg (82\% of TC), suggesting that a large amount of TC could be potentially stored for centuries to millennia. Our estimates of soil C and fractions within a mixed-use watershed in Florida highlight the importance of appropriately characterizing the inherent spatial dependence structure of soil C, as well as relevant regional environmental patterns (e.g., hydrology), to better explain the variability of soil C.},

	abstract = {Amount, composition, and rate of turnover of soil organic carbon (SOC) in mountainous cold regions is largely unknown, making predictions of future responses of this carbon (C) to changing environmental conditions uncertain. We hypothesized increasing amounts and declining turnover times of soil organic matter (SOM) under permanent grassland with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature. Samples from an irrigated transect in the Swiss Alps (880 to 2200 m elevation, mean annual temperatures +8.9 to +0.9 °C) were analyzed. Soil C stocks ranged from 49 to 96 t C ha−1 (0–20 cm) and were not related to elevation, though the highest site stored least C. Particulate organic carbon (POC) increased significantly with elevation and accounted for {\textgreater} 80\% of the total soil C at 2200 m (0–5 cm). Mean residence times (MRTs) of POC computed by means of radiocarbon dating were in the order of years to decades and were positively related to elevation in the topsoil. At higher elevations, the estimated total C flux through the soil profile mainly depended on this fraction. MRT of mineral-associated matter ranged from decades to centuries and was not systematically related to elevation, but positively related to the soil mineral surface area and it increased with soil depth. Turnover rates from simulations with the soil C model RothC exceeded those from 14C measurements by a factor of 1.7–3.3 which suggests that C dynamics at these sites is overestimated by the model. Size of model pools and amount of C in soil fractions were only weakly correlated, thereby challenging previously postulated hypotheses concerning the correspondence of pools and fractions for grasslands at higher elevations.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas SOC stocks are highly variable at the agroecosystem scale. Optimized sampling and estimation approaches are crucial for low cost SOC assessment. Systematic sampling provided thorough geographic and attribute space coverage. Ordinary kriging outperformed regression kriging, simple mean, and SSURGO approaches. Low-cost approaches for measuring soil organic C (SOC) stocks are essential for verifying farm management effects on C sequestration in agroecosystems. This study compared sampling and data analysis optimization approaches for estimating SOC stocks of a complex agroecosystem. Soil samples were collected from a 232-ha area of a working dairy farm with multiple land uses, crop rotations, topographic features, and manure application rates. The SOC stocks were estimated by (i) simple mean, (ii) ordinary kriging, (iii) regression kriging, and (iv) using the USDA Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. Relationships among sampling schemes, estimation approaches, auxiliary information, and SOC stocks were explored. Slope, elevation, soil type, and land use types displayed a high degree of variation at the study site, yet relationships with SOC stocks were weak or nonsignificant. Systematic sampling provided the best coverage of both geographic and attribute space, allowing reliable variogram estimates and RMSEs that increased little with reduced sample number. Random and stratified random sampling approaches resulted in reduced accuracy. Ordinary kriging had lower RMSEs than either regression kriging or the simple mean, and total SOC stocks estimates fluctuated less when sample sizes were reduced. Using SSURGO overestimated total SOC stocks by up to 5.1\% compared with the other approaches, suggesting that this approach may be worthy of evaluation for circumstances with a low budget and low confidence level requirements. Systematic sampling and ordinary kriging can provide an optimal strategy for estimating SOC stocks in agroecosystems with complex topography and land uses.},

	abstract = {Widespread implementation of precision agriculture practices requires low-cost, high-quality data such as soil organic C (SOC) content, but SOC mapping currently requires expensive sample collection and analysis techniques. Soils higher in organic C appear darker than surrounding soils in aerial imagery after tillage, although this difference is only relative without knowledge of the range of SOC. This range could be estimated from Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database. To verify this, the SSURGO database was used to estimate the SOC range at three sites in central Iowa. Soil organic C content across each field was then linearly interpolated within the SSURGO-estimated range for each field using the brightness values at each pixel in the aerial photograph as a scaling factor. Measured SOC data from the three sites ranged from 3.4 to 50 g kg−1 and the R2 and RMSE values between the measured and estimated SOC concentrations ranged from 0.60 to 0.82 and 3.5 to 7.6 g kg−1, respectively. Limited thresholding of the brightest and darkest pixels improved the accuracy and precision of SOC estimates over raw imagery. These results imply that aerial imagery supplemented by SSURGO-estimated SOC ranges can provide georeferenced SOC estimates suitable for site-specific recommendations and analysis without field sampling.},

This soil organic C sequestration was largely due to drastic changes in management practices, such as fertilization, tillage, and residue treatments, induced by economic and policy incentives. Our analysis also indicates that excessive N inputs and inability to incorporate residue C into deeper soils will likely constrain the future C sequestration in Chinese croplands. These findings provide new insights into the causes and limitations of economics- and policy-driven soil C sequestration in China and offer some guidance for soil C management in many developing countries that are going through the similar economic and social transformations.

              China’s croplands have experienced drastic changes in management practices, such as fertilization, tillage, and residue treatments, since the 1980s. There is an ongoing debate about the impact of these changes on soil organic carbon (SOC) and its implications. Here we report results from an extensive study that provided direct evidence of cropland SOC sequestration in China. Based on the soil sampling locations recorded by the Second National Soil Survey of China in 1980, we collected 4,060 soil samples in 2011 from 58 counties that represent the typical cropping systems across China. Our results showed that across the country, the average SOC stock in the topsoil (0–20 cm) increased from 28.6 Mg C ha
              −1
              in 1980 to 32.9 Mg C ha
              −1
              in 2011, representing a net increase of 140 kg C ha
              −1
              year
              −1
              . However, the SOC change differed among the major agricultural regions: SOC increased in all major agronomic regions except in Northeast China. The SOC sequestration was largely attributed to increased organic inputs driven by economics and policy: while higher root biomass resulting from enhanced crop productivity by chemical fertilizers predominated before 2000, higher residue inputs following the large-scale implementation of crop straw/stover return policy took over thereafter. The SOC change was negatively related to N inputs in East China, suggesting that the excessive N inputs, plus the shallowness of plow layers, may constrain the future C sequestration in Chinese croplands. Our results indicate that cropland SOC sequestration can be achieved through effectively manipulating economic and policy incentives to farmers.},

Here we apply an innovative approach combining space-for-time substitution with meta-analysis to SOC measurements in 113,013 soil profiles across the globe to estimate the effect of future climate warming on steady-state SOC stocks. We find that SOC stock will reduce by 6.0 ± 1.6\% (mean±95\% confidence interval), 4.8 ± 2.3\% and 1.3 ± 4.0\% at 0–0.3, 0.3–1 and 1–2 m soil depths, respectively, under 1 °C air warming, with additional 4.2\%, 2.2\% and 1.4\% losses per every additional 1 °C warming, respectively. The largest proportional SOC losses occur in boreal forests. Existing SOC level is the predominant determinant of the spatial variability of SOC changes with higher percentage losses in SOC-rich soils. Our work demonstrates that warming induces more proportional SOC losses in topsoil than in subsoil, particularly from high-latitudinal SOC-rich systems.},

	abstract = {Cover crops have been reported as one of the most effective practices to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) for agroecosystems. Impacts of cover crops on SOC change vary depending on soil properties, climate, and management practices, but it remains unclear how these control factors affect SOC benefits from cover crops, as well as which management practices can maximize SOC benefits. To address these questions, we used an advanced process-based agroecosystem model, ecosys, to assess the impacts of winter cover cropping on SOC accumulation under different environmental and management conditions. We aimed to answer the following questions: (1) To what extent do cover crops benefit SOC accumulation, and how do SOC benefits from cover crops vary with different factors (i.e., initial soil properties, cover crop types, climate during the cover crop growth period, and cover crop planting and terminating time)? (2) How can we enhance SOC benefits from cover crops under different cover crop management options? Specifically, we first calibrated and validated the ecosys model at two long-term field experiment sites with SOC measurements in Illinois. We then applied the ecosys model to six cover crop field experiment sites spanning across Illinois to assess the impacts of different factors on SOC accumulation. Our modeling results revealed the following findings: (1) Growing cover crops can bring SOC benefits by 0.33 ± 0.06 MgC ha−1 year−1 in six cover crop field experiment sites across Illinois, and the SOC benefits are species specific to legume and non-legume cover crops. (2) Initial SOC stocks and clay contents had overall small influences on SOC benefits from cover crops. During the cover crop growth period (i.e., winter and spring in the US Midwest), high temperature increased SOC benefits from cover crops, while the impacts from larger precipitation on SOC benefits varied field by field. (3) The SOC benefits from cover crops can be maximized by optimizing cover crop management practices (e.g., selecting cover crop types and controlling cover crop growth period) for the US Midwestern maize–soybean rotation system. Finally, we discussed the economic and policy implications of adopting cover crops in the US Midwest, including that current economic incentives to grow cover crops may not be sufficient to cover costs. This study systematically assessed cover crop impacts for SOC change in the US Midwest context, while also demonstrating that the ecosys model, with rigorous validation using field experiment data, can be an effective tool to guide the adaptive management of cover crops and quantify SOC benefits from cover crops. The study thus provides practical tools and insights for practitioners and policy-makers to design cover crop related government agricultural policies and incentive programs for farmers and agri-food related industries.},

Our objective was to assess CC treatment and planting practice effects on CC biomass, spring soil nitrate concentrations, and soybean yield at two rainfed sites in eastern and one irrigated site in south-central Nebraska over 4 yr. Cover crop treatments (cereal rye [Secale cereale L.] [RYE] and a mix of rye, legume, and brassica species [MIX]) were planted by broadcast interseeding into corn stands in September (pre-harvest broadcast) or drilling after corn harvest (post-harvest drilled) and terminated 2 wk before planting soybean. Cover crop biomass and N uptake varied between years, but generally at the eastern sites, pre-harvest broadcasting produced more biomass than post-harvest drilling (1.64 and 0.79 Mg ha−1, respectively) and had greater N uptake (37 and 24 kg ha−1, respectively). At the south-central site, post-harvest drilling produced more than pre-harvest broadcasting (1.44 and 1.20 Mg ha−1, respectively). RYE had more biomass than MIX (1.41 and 1.09 Mg ha−1, respectively), but the same N uptake. Soil nitrate reductions after CC were small. In 3 of 12 site-years, soybean yielded less after pre-harvest CC. Yield reductions were not correlated to CC biomass, but were likely due to greater weed pressure. High CC productivity is necessary for high N uptake, and requires site-specific selection of planting practice and CC treatments.},

	abstract = {Climate models indicate that increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases could alter climate globally. The EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) model was used to examine the sensitivity of corn and soybean yields over the US corn belt to changes in temperature, precipitation, wind, and atmospheric CO2 concentration. A statistically representative sample of 100 corn and soybean production sites was selected from the 1987 National Resources Inventory (NRI). One-hundred-year simulations were run for each site under 36 different climate/CO2 scenarios. The results were area weighted according to the NRI area expansion factors to produce a regionally aggregated estimate of yields. EPIC did an excellent job of reproducing current regional mean expected yields under the baseline scenario. There were 3\% decreases in both corn and soybean yields in response to a 2°C temperature increase at baseline precipitation levels, with larger and smaller temperature effects under drier and wetter conditions, respectively. Crop yields increased and decreased in response to increases and decreases of 10\% or 20\% precipitation. A 10\% precipitation increase roughly balanced the negative effect of the 2°C temperature increase. Whether the precipitation changes resulted from altered precipitation event frequency or amount per event had little effect on mean crop yields; however interannual yield variability was higher when precipitation decreases were due to frequency rather than intensity. The opposite was true, though to a lesser extent, for precipitation increases. Potential evapotranspiration responded linearly to changes in mean wind speed, leading to modest changes of 1–3 days of water stress per growing season, yield increases of up to 2\% for decreased wind, and yield decreases of up to 6\% for increased wind. Elevated CO2 concentrations of 625 ppmv gave the greatest yield increases, + 17\% for corn and + 27\% for soybean at baseline temperature and precipitation levels. The relative CO2 effect was larger under drier conditions.},

	abstract = {The USA accounts for 38 and 35\% of global maize and soybean production, producing a respective 320 and 84 Mt of these crops annually. More than 85\% of those totals are produced in the north-central region known as the ‘Corn Belt’, where continuous maize and 2-year maize–soybean rotation are the dominant cropping systems. This chapter describes the climate, soil, and management practices of high-yield maize–soybean cropping systems in the Corn Belt. Major drivers for higher yields and resource-use efficiency are evaluated and opportunities for further improvement are discussed. Yield and input-use efficiency of maize and soybean in the US Corn Belt have increased steadily during the last 40 years as a result of (1) continuous genetic improvement, (2) intermittently phased periods of agronomic improvement, and (3) the synergistic interaction of improved genetics and agronomy. Future increases may be difficult to achieve as on-farm yields approach yield potential; however, some of the yield gap between on-farm yield and simulated yield potential can still be captured by fine-tuning crop management in a manner that increases yield, while simultaneously reducing the resource input amount or cost. Indeed, substantive opportunities exist for increased input-use efficiency by scheduling just-in-time irrigation events of the minimum amount needed, and by optimizing management of N fertilizer to be temporally and spatially effective.},

These payments are motivated by environmental benefits, including improved soil health, reduced erosion, and increased soil organic carbon. However, previous work based on experimental plots or crop modeling indicates cover crops may reduce crop yields. It remains unclear, though, how recent cover crop adoption has affected productivity in commercial agricultural systems. Here we perform the first large-scale, field-level analysis of observed yield impacts from cover cropping as implemented across the US Corn Belt. We use validated satellite data products at sub-field scales to analyze maize and soybean yield outcomes for over 90,000 fields in 2019–2020. Because we lack data on cover crop species or timing, we seek to quantify the yield impacts of cover cropping as currently practiced in aggregate. Using causal forests analysis, we estimate an average maize yield loss of 5.5\% on fields where cover crops were used for 3 or more years, compared with fields that did not adopt cover cropping. Maize yield losses were larger on fields with better soil ratings, cooler mid-season temperatures, and lower spring rainfall. For soybeans, average yield losses were 3.5\%, with larger impacts on fields with warmer June temperatures, lower spring and late-season rainfall, and, to a lesser extent, better soils. Estimated impacts are consistent with multiple mechanisms indicated by experimental and simulation-based studies, including the effects of cover crops on nitrogen dynamics, water consumption, and soil oxygen depletion. Our results suggest a need to improve cover crop management to reduce yield penalties, and a potential need to target subsidies based on likely yield impacts. Ultimately, avoiding substantial yield penalties is important for realizing widespread adoption and associated benefits for water quality, erosion, soil carbon, and greenhouse gas emissions.},

	abstract = {Using land already enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in the eastern region of the U.S. for producing energy crops for bioenergy while reducing land rental payments offers the potential for lowering the program costs, increasing returns to CRP landowners, and displacing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuels. We develop an integrated modeling approach to analyze the combination of biomass prices and CRP land rental payment reductions that can incentivize energy crop production on CRP land and its potential to increase soil carbon stocks and displace fossil fuel emissions. We find that conversion of 3.4 million ha in the CRP can be economically viable at a minimum biomass price of \$75 Mg–1 with full CRP land rental payment or at \$100 Mg–1 with 75\% of this land rental payment; this conversion can result in savings of 0.52 and 1.25 billion Mg CO2-eq in life-cycle emissions through the displacement of energy-equivalent fossil fuels and coal-based electricity, respectively, and an additional 0.11 billion Mg CO2-eq soil carbon sequestration relative to the status quo, with CRP left unharvested over the 2016–2030 period. The soil carbon debt due to the transition from unharvested CRP land to energy crops is short-lived and more than offset by the reduction in fossil fuel emissions. The net discounted benefits from producing energy crops on CRP land through a reduced need for government payments to maintain existing enrollment, higher returns to CRP landowners, and the value of the reduction in GHG emissions could be as high as \$16–\$30 billion by using them for cellulosic biofuels to displace gasoline and \$35–\$68 billion by displacing coal-based electricity over the 2016–2030 period if biomass prices are \$75–\$125 Mg–1 and land rental payments are reduced by 25\%.},

	abstract = {Policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are likely to increase energy prices. Higher energy prices raise farmer costs for diesel and other fuels, irrigation water, farm chemicals, and grain drying. Simultaneously, renewable energy options become more attractive to agricultural producers. We consider both of these impacts, estimating the economic and environmental consequences of higher energy prices on U.S. agriculture. To do this we employ a price-endogenous agricultural sector model and solve that model for a range of carbon-tax-based energy price changes. Our results show mostly positive impacts on net farm income in the intermediate run. Through market price adjustments, fossil fuel costs are largely passed on to consumers. Additional farm revenue arises from the production of biofuels when carbon taxes reach \$30 per ton of carbon or more. Positive environmental benefits include not only greenhouse gas emission offsets but also reduced levels of nitrogen leaching.},

	abstract = {'Corn, Carbon, and Conservation: Rethinking U.S. Agricultural Policy in a  Changing Global Environment', is the first law review article to explore the complex relationship between U.S. agricultural policy, as reflected in the 2008 “Farm Bill,” and the current climate change and energy crises.  In recent years, the public has renewed its interest in ensuring that the food it eats is healthy and is grown in ways that are environmentally and economically sustainable. The immense popularity of books such as The Omnivore’s Dilemma, the widespread “locavore” movement, First Lady Michelle Obama’s White House lawn vegetable garden, concerns over genetically modified crops, rising food prices, growing concerns over the government’s misguided policy to promote corn ethanol, and the climate change crisis have refocused the public’s attention on the nation’s agricultural policies and their impact on human health and the environment and a sustainable energy future. This Article explores a range of issues related to both the regulatory and incentive-based federal programs that affect the crops we grow, the manner in which they are grown, and the human and environmental impacts of such programs.  One of the most promising means of accomplishing the goal of transforming our agricultural system into one that is environmentally and economically sustainable is to combine existing commodity subsidy programs with existing conservation subsidy programs into one subsidy program, which compensates farmers of a wide variety of crops for conserving a range of critical ecosystem services.  Such an approach could result in a shift from an agricultural system in which croplands are in essence industrial wastelands with little or no ecological value and which are used primarily to produce industrial feedstocks, to a more sustainable system in which agricultural lands are healthy, sustainable systems providing a number of critical ecosystem services that benefit the public and serving as a source of healthful food.},
